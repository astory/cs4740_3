The selection is right if it truly works for the competing student ,  and it is the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the performance of the piece .  The most important thing is your firm knowledge that the selection is within your present range .  It 's not much use arriving somewhere at ten in the morning clutching the collected works under your <head>arm</head> and wishing you had a wig and been born thirty years earlier in order to play Lear or for that matter the Duke of Gloucester . Major roles for older women are not so common in Shakespeare ,  but I think it is better not to choose a character such as Queen Katherine from Henry VIII  ,  who needs a richness of seniority to convey the dramatic interest .  If you do want to portray an older figure ,  it would be preferable to try Hermione in The Winter 's  Tale   she is a more fantastical character ,  without the added complications of historical authenticity ,  and so allows for greater flexibility of characterisation .

It is possible for such sentiments of approval of this past to coexist with abhorrence for most current acts of violence .  But the political significance of this culture is that where opinion counts and where the catholic  nationalist remnant actually experiences the coercive power of protestant loyalists and the British army in the Northern statelet ,  there violence has all the more support .  When it does , it tends to be a reaction to perceived injustice , such as internment without trial , or the conviction of a son by a sole judge in a trial held in total secrecy and on the evidence of unseen witnesses , or a simple case of one 's house being badly mauled by careless soldiers searching for <head>arms</head> . This reactive violence is thus justified by its subjects and the justification subsists  in consciousness along with their Roman catholic profession of faith and identity .  The provisional IRA 's  commitment to violence against the British and against the protestant  loyalist alliance ,  which the provisionals rhetorically and conveniently subsume under the term the British ,  is frequently assumed to be based on either Marxist or nationalist principles and in both cases to be secularist or areligious .

It is important to practise adjusting the airbrakes during the float and to kick yourself hard if you ever land short of your point with brake still applied .  It simply means that you have frozen on the airbrake lever and have undershot when you could have saved the situation .  This is the same as throttle <head>arm</head> paralysis on a powered aircraft when the pilot undershoots and crashes his aircraft . He could have pushed the throttle forwards and avoided the accident by using the engine .  It is also worthwhile attempting the occasional no airbrake touch down to get a better idea of how far your glider will float .

Such special knowledge holds further difficulties ,  for it highlights the specifically political nature of any ethnographic account  of such an institution ,  bringing to the forefront those expectations of loyalty which the executive demands of any individual who has hold of the account .  Ethical problems will surface ,  for no power - based organization likes to have its idiosyncrasies made public ,  and the anthropologist who is a member of the family and not merely a temporary visitor to the backyard exotica can find that writing anything at all becomes crucially problematic .  Expectations of confidentiality and silence prevent many accounts from reaching fruition , for as the revelations of Spycatcher ( Wright and Greenglass 1986 ) revealed , it is not necessarily what is written which causes the pain ; rather it is the breach of the convention which requires members in various <head>arms</head> of the executive to say nothing about their practices . This returns us to Arendt 's  observation that secrecy is a prerequisite of totalitarianism ,  for those involved in the executive use of power know that to reveal is antagonistic to its maintenance .  The insider/anthropologist is therefore somewhat schizophrenic ,  something of a Jekyll and Hyde ,  for he knows that publication and explication might be career - suicidal but are necessary intellectual tasks .

In their own research departments the police continuously attempt to measure aspects of their activity ,  largely to demonstrate cost effectiveness in line with criteria imposed by the limits on public spending  ( HO Circular 114/83 )  and the prevalent socio - economic world view of society .  This has meant that many studies tend to concentrate on the objective assessment of a fiscally quantifiable reality .  For example , the Audit Commission ( an <head>arm</head> of the treasury ) spent some time in 1987/8 with myself and others in a police research department assessing an OSU ( Operational Support Unit ) administrative system which they claimed had revolutionized police decision making and released manpower for patrol equal to 6.358 million . However ,  a colleague looking at these OSUs in relation to their cultural impact ,  saw there were many aspects of a qualitative nature which could not easily be expressed in fiscal terms  ( Adams 1988 :  11 )  :  direct submission of reports to the 0 .

Since this condemnation of research opportunity ,  few studies have penetrated deeply beneath the sensitive skin of police culture ,  and even though Chatterton in his notes to my thesis argued there has been a considerable amount of participant police research ,  I would question whether many of these inquiries achieved the finer grain and detail ' of the insider 's  account ,  for they can never really know or tell if they have been excluded from the inner workings of police practice or prevented from gaining access to the hidden realities contained inside the heads of the constables .  Because of the litism which such an organization of control wields ,  it is not surprising there is difficulty in incorporating the outside researcher ,  or in accepting his critical findings .  And certainly that other main <head>arm</head> of executive control the army seems little better at this than the police , for the number of participant accounts of their deep structures remains negligible , supporting McCabe 's ( 1980 ) contention that we should be asking of all of these costly institutions , who is to be controlled by whom and for what reasons ? Meanwhile ,  as Reiner  ( 1985 )  suggests ,  the politicization of the police has proceeded at a pace ,  and can be illustrated by their growing willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy .  This trend is further displayed in their growing tendency to agree to be used as a pseudo - military arm of government in its socio - economic and industrial/political disputes with whole sections of society .

Arm movement Economy of <head>arm</head> movement is important since the more you flail them about , the longer it takes to cock them for an effective punch . Move your arms as little as is necessary to achieve your purpose ,  and always move them together so that if the front hand is knocking down an incoming punch ,  the rear is executing a counter - punch .

The third example uses a short but wide diagonal movement of the front foot to take you clear of the opponent 's  incoming reverse punch .  Use a long ,  thrusting snap punch to the opponent 's  face and if the chance presents itself ,  follow up quickly with a reverse punch .  If the opponent 's attack is a face punch , then hit his extended <head>arm</head> with your forearm , glancing your punch over the top of his and into the target .

The second requirement is that of good timing .  Some competitors just are n't quick enough off the mark ,  or they hold back instead of thrusting in strongly .  Either of these faults means that the attacking technique is well developed before you move into it , and so your front barring <head>arm</head> or groin suffer accordingly . Move directly into a high roundhouse kick and stop - punch it Stop a front kick by barring down with your leading guard whilst reverse - punching to the opponent 's  chest

To do this you slide back your rear foot so that the stance lengthens  ( this makes it more stable in a longitudinal direction )  and your centre of gravity drops .  If the action is sharp enough your opponent 's  punch will graze over the top of your head ,  helped on its way by a fast rising block .  As well as dealing with the punch , the rising block travels diagonally up and forwards into the opponent , catching him high on the attacking <head>arm</head> . Do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring your chin close to the opponent 's  other fist .  There is no need to withdraw your blocking arm fully as you reverse punch ;  you probably wo n't have enough time to anyway !

As well as dealing with the punch ,  the rising block travels diagonally up and forwards into the opponent ,  catching him high on the attacking arm .  Do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring your chin close to the opponent 's  other fist .  There is no need to withdraw your blocking <head>arm</head> fully as you reverse punch ; you probably wo n't have enough time to anyway ! The main thing is to shift your centre of gravity forwards behind the punch ,  so that it is delivered with plenty of power .  Simply rock forwards on to your leading knee to achieve this .

Even if the slide is not feasible ,  you can still throw your centre of gravity forward ,  so that weight increases on the leading leg .  The fifth attention - grabber is the exaggerated hip action which should accompany every punch .  This shows that the punch is not merely an <head>arm</head> movement , but a powerful , co - ordinated body action . The punching hip ,  be it the leading hip of a front punch or the trailing hip of a reverse punch ,  must swivel forwards ,  so that your centre - line directly faces the opponent .  You may well decide to twist even further when using the front punch ,  but beware that your situation is weakened should the opponent immediately counter  attack .

The back fist This punch is not a linear strike like the previous two but a circular one .  The back fist unrolls from the shoulder , propelled as much by the body turning away as by the <head>arm</head> action itself . Many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the arm action .  A back fist will out - range a reverse punch performed by an opponent of equal height but it is not often scored because many referees do not consider it powerful enough .

Lean in behind the strike in order to get the maximum range ,  and raise your other hand as a guard .  Unfortunately ,  the cocking action that begins a back fist movement presents an unmistakable cue to the opponent .  The punching elbow must be flexed before it can be extended fully , and any attempt to strike with a semi - extended <head>arm</head> is sure to fail because of the obvious weakness of the technique . The question is ,  how do you disguise the elbow flexion ?  One answer is to open with a reverse punch to the mid - section .

Also ,  the opponent may fall in an unexpected direction ,  so that you have to spin around and perhaps take a step to reach him. By that time ,  of course ,  the element of surprise is lost and his guard is ready and waiting .  The remainder of the sequence then degenerates into a mle of pumping <head>arms</head> and legs . The hook At this point it is necessary to distinguish between foot sweeps and hooks .

If they took a whirl at the minister ,  he would have a fine sight of the fun .  Two days ago when they had carted out Menzies the minister and Fleming the young teacher from along the road at Dull and danced round them like children at a Halloween fire and stuck them up on horses ,  facing backwards ,  and paraded them past the door and down the road to Aberfeldy ,  he had flung a soft carrot himself and caught the man on the side of his face .  He had deserved all he got was that what ministers and teachers were paid for ? to draw up the militia lists and condemn the young men to the barracks and the camps , to swamp fever in the Indies and their legs and <head>arms</head> blown off ? Young Donald  his eyes were clear black - brown ,  like a lochan stained with peat ,  his hair was curly like a bull 's  poll ,  and he had been a lovely lad until his father went away ,  clever with his hands ,  whittling pieces of wood and glueing them to make little windmills and watermills .  The wheel he had mounted on a bit of rod from Stewart 's  smithy still turned freely in the burn at the side of the kail - yard .

Before the crowd could drift off ,  Cameron got up on the massive stone gate - post and called on them to swear an oath .

It had looked like a melodrama a little group in a candle - lit attic , holding up their <head>arms</head> with fists clenched and swearing to do or die . But they had meant it ,  and he was eager now to bring everybody together in a fine ,  hard point of resolve ,  in case zeal slackened and died away in the holiday atmosphere of this soft ,  comfortable afternoon .  The hills themselves looked asleep ,  the heather glowed dust - blue in the hazy light ,  and the people ,  after a night of little sleep and hours of walking and standing ,  now looked stunned as they sat on the grassy banks ,  leaned on dykes ,  or lay on their backs in the hayfields ,  munching oatcakes and drinking the last of their water .

The pectoralis minor lies underneath the pectoralis major and in almost all cases any reference to the pecs means the pectoralis major .  The pecs respond fairly quickly regular training ,  especially the bench press .  The main function of pecs is to adduct the <head>arms</head> ( adduction is a movement towards the centre - line of the body ) , that is they move the upper arms across the body as in dumb - bell flyes . Other movements brought about by the pecs are shoulder flexion ,  which draws the arm forwards and upwards ,  and shoulder extension ,  which draws the arm down and forwards .  By working the pecs from different angles it is possible to direct the work - load to different parts of the muscle .

After the legs ,  the back is the most neglected area in terms of training and development .  The reason for this is very simple  you ca n't see it .  An individual will get far more pleasure working his chest , his abdominals or his <head>arms</head> because he can see the muscles working and developing . Also ,  it is much harder to train the back muscles and receive a hard pump .  The back consists of 3 main sections ;  the lower ,  the middle and the upper back .

The skeletal width of the shoulders is hereditary but an illusion of breadth can be created by fully developing the shoulder muscles .  These muscles are called the deltoids and have 3 heads ;  anterior  ( front )  ,  lateral  ( side )  and posterior  ( rear )  .  The heads form a cap which covers the shoulder joint , and they are attached at one end to the upper <head>arm</head> and at the other end to 3 points to the front , top and back of the shoulder . The function of the deltoids is to raise the arm to the front ,  the side and the rear .  All 3 of the heads of the deltoids are involved in shoulder movements ,  but the direction of the arm movement determines which head is being used the most .

Firstly ,  training the biceps is very enjoyable and the results are easily seen .  Secondly ,  the biceps respond very quickly to training and are relatively easy to develop compared to the triceps .  Upper <head>arm</head> training should be in the ratio of 3 : 2 for triceps to biceps . It is always best to train the triceps first because these are usually the least developed group .  There are 3 heads to the triceps ;  2 of them have their origins on the humerus and the third originates on the shoulder blade .

At risk of seeming a killjoy ,  I would urge readers to think through the implications of all home - made safety devices which set out to resolve some well - acknowledged safety problem only to create others of a less obvious by more hazardous nature .  Remembering that anything that bodes to threaten concentration in wood - machining is a prime risk ,  let us consider a router cutter revolving at anything up to 24,000rpm sitting midway between 12 highly unstably - sprung devices whose proper purpose in life is the support of wet laundry on a clothes line .  It takes little imagination to foretell the likely consequences of just one peg disintegrating and flinging its spring or its free <head>arm</head> into the cutter gap during a pass ; or the possible knock - on effect ( s ) on the rest of the makeshift assembly and the astonished operator if this should happen . There have been better hold - down devices of a home - made nature in Woodworker  in the past  the best of them doubtless designed after some careful thoughts about an acceptable specification .  Mr Wiseman does n't only have the safety of his hands to consider :  in this case he might stand to lose his sight or sustain laceration from bits of flying clothespegs ,  blocks and cramps into the bargain .

In following Stravinsky 's  guidelines ,  Ashton found many new ,  sometimes frivolous ,  ways of performing class - room steps .  The corps de ballet  neglect the turn - out and step forwards sur les pointes  ,  raising the working knee and resting the toe on the calf of the other leg ,  before moving forwards .  They travel forwards instead of en place in chapp relevs after breaking the rule that the <head>arms</head> never cross the centre line of the body and are always ( except in arabesque ) rounded . If Ashton 's  Scnes de Ballet  is compared with Balanchine 's  Ballet Imperial  ,  it will be seen that Balanchine rarely breaks away from the classical technique as practised in petipa 's  day when Tchaikovsky wrote the music .  Ashton ,  like Stravinsky ,  took into account the technical developments which had taken place .

Dancers easily understand how a series of swift pas de bourre courus   ( i.e. running on the toes )  as danced by the Queen of the Wilis in Giselle  ,  differs from the same step performed piqu   ( i.e. each foot picked up sharply at each change of weight )  ,  as in many of petipa 's  solos .  But it is not always easy to decide which is the more appropriate ,  nor how the two ways mentioned can lead to other versions .  for example , in her solo in Ashton 's Cinderella the Winter Fairy moves across the stage in a series of pas de bourre en tournant terre , the feet weaving their in - and - out pattern as the <head>arms</head> flick to and fro sparkling with frost . In Symphonic  Variations  ,  the dancers perform pas de bourre piqus sur les pointes  very gently because they are marking the rhythmic beat as the soloist dances to the melodic phrase .  This is an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythms are explicitly brought to life by the dance design  ( see page 68 )  .

This is an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythms are explicitly brought to life by the dance design  ( see page 68 )  .  One of the most beautiful uses of pas de bourre courus is when Ashton places his danseuse in her partner 's <head>arms</head> as she floats over the surface of the floor as if in a dream like ecstasy . It is a movement he has used many times and which is perhaps seen at its best in the pas de deux  to the Meditation  from Thai - s  created for Anthony Dowell and Antoinette Sibley ;  in A Month in the Country  when Natalia dances with the Tutor to express her emotions ;  and in Les Deux Pigeons  in the final pas de deux  ,  when the Young Man has returned to The Girl and tenderly dances with her in his arms  ( see page 83 )  .  It was this ability to display a ballerina 's  apparent weightlessness and sheer joy in dance that was so impressive when the Spirits of the Air danced in Homage to the  Queen  ,  Ashton 's  exquisite celebration of the 1952 Coronation which was danced by Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes .

But such jumps can also travel some way forwards ,  backwards or sideways and can become sparklingly light when the knees are sharply bent upwards at the height of the jump .  This is required of the Four Fairies ,  the Fairy Godmother and the Stars in Ashton 's  Cinderella  .  However if this way of jumping from two feet to two feet had not been combined with well picked - up pas de bourre piqus and relevs retirs as well as extremely accurate , quick ports de bras with straighter and more angled than rounded <head>arms</head> , they would have seemed out of place . When moving dancers from two feet to one in both open and closed sissonnes  ,  the choreographer can make the movements dart over the floor as Aurora does in her final solo in The Sleeping Beauty  .  In Les Patineurs  and Les Rendezvous  Ashton makes his dancers travel upwards as well in an effort to show off their abilities to keep up with the music and beat each other to the exit .

It can be that magic moment in such dances as the Rose Adage in The  Sleeping Beauty  when Aurora triumphantly raises her hand from the fourth Prince 's  grasp and holds the final attitude  for several seconds revealing her complete command over the forces of gravity .  There are hundreds of instances of this kind of pose created by many different choreographers .  There is the moment in the Act II pas de deux or Swan Lake where Odette appears to fly away in an arabesque before Siegfried seizes her <head>arms</head> and draws her body close to his in an embrace . There are also the exciting poses that come at the end of some of Ashton 's  pas de deux  as the two characters declare their love ,  for example ,  when Oberon cradles Titania in his arms at the end of The Dream  and ,  even more excitingly ,  when Colas lifts Lise high on one arm it the end of their dance in Act II of La Fille Mai Garde  as if to crown her queen of the harvest In some modern classical ballets too little attention is paid to the momentary holding of a pose as the focus of a picture to sum up  as it were  what has gone before .

For example  :  in Choros  he focuses attention on many ancient Greek dance rituals and accents the playful use of movement whilst at the same time showing that such warlike ,  athletic courtship and other activities are a wonderful game to be played by the performers .  In Consort Lessons  these quick changes of aulement  give much greater variety and dimension to the overall design particularly where the solo girl dances with four boys .  More recently , in his The Sons of Horus he has found ways of incorporating the profiled attitudes and poses seen in ancient Egyptian designs with straight turned - in legs , elongated lines and angled <head>arms</head> , all in contrast to the turnedout legs and curving bodies of classical dance . As Ashton and MacMillan in many of their ballets ,  he has created a style appropriate to one particular ballet .

Petipa 's  remark that without ports de bras  the dancer is dumb is only one of the wise comments he made when working on his choreographic designs .  Fokine echoed this remark when he said every step and pose is a gesture  ( see page 58 )  .  De Valois summed up the ideas of these two great choreographers by saying : Only synchronisation of <head>arms</head> and legs will give symmetry to step and pose , strength to the jump , speed to the pirouettes , calm to the adage and spaciousness to the dance . To ensure that his audience would appreciate each sentence in his dance ,  petipa usually repeated each at least twice and usually four times .  But towards the end of the second or fourth repeat he made some small alteration in the ports de bras  so that the dancer could move easily into the next sentence .

This is particularly noticeable in his variations for the Six fairies in The Sleeping Beauty  .  Petipa clearly reflects in dance the gift that each fairy brings to the Christening .  The first Fairy is slow and gracious to denote Beauty ; she encircles her face with her hand and displays the line of her <head>arm</head> ( the traditional gesture for beauty ) . The Second Fairy brings Grace and dances slightly faster in such a way that she shows off the lines of her body as it faces forwards and then backwards  ( the traditional gesture )  .  The Third Fairy dances slowly sur les pointes  and uses conventional hand movements to show she brings the gift of Plenty ,  just as the godmother at a Russian christening scatters breadcrumbs over the cradle .

Any untoward or awkward transition is immediately noticeable because it destroys the calm dignity that the human body needs if it is to be shown at its best .  This does not mean that speed must be avoided ,  nor that the unexpected need offend the eye .  A sudden change of aulement , an unusual turn in - out of legs or <head>arms</head> , or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design . Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton 's  five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros  and Consort Lessons  .  In fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift changes add a touch of humour as two or more dancers compete to capture the attention of both the audience and their Colleagues .

Later the mass of dancers merely moves upstage sur les pointes  to a pose and further ports de  bras  ,  then returns downstage to another slowly unfolding set of ports de bras  and arabesques  .  It is when this mass of dancers divides and moves to the sides that the open space available for dancing is exposed fur the first time .  Before this the slowmoving dancers in their wide spreading tutus and veiled <head>arms</head> have hidden it from view . Its exposure prepares the audience for the brilliant solos to follow .  When Marie Camargo shortened her skirts and removed the heels from her shoes ,  jumps and batterie  first entered the vocabulary .

The demi - caractre  style has its roots in classical technique ,  but must be coloured by more clearly defined and individual movements which allow the dancers to show they are playing the part of some character who has some claim to live in the real world and therefore can be recognised as such .  In other words they usually ,  dance classically from their feet to the waist and above that are free to express themselves as people of more definite behaviour ,  work ,  play and age  ( de Valois in a lecture to teachers ,  1947 )  .  The head , body and <head>arms</head> of the characters portrayed should show the status they have in the society to which they belong whether it is rural , urban or fantastic , as well as their behaviour , customs , work or play . Dauberval 's  La Fille Mal Gard   ( 1789 )  was the first ballet in this style .  Dauberval 's  exclusion from the Acadmie Royale  ( later the Paris Opera )  was justified by those in charge because they felt his idea of making farmers ,  peasants and the like the heroes and heroines of his ballets was beneath the dignity of an opera house whose stage had hitherto been occupied with the deeds of noble heroes ,  heroines and courts .

Dauberval 's  exclusion from the Acadmie Royale  ( later the Paris Opera )  was justified by those in charge because they felt his idea of making farmers ,  peasants and the like the heroes and heroines of his ballets was beneath the dignity of an opera house whose stage had hitherto been occupied with the deeds of noble heroes ,  heroines and courts .  Bournonville coloured his ballets with movements characteristic of many different personalities and nationalities .  In his particular style of demi - caractre dance he used classical footwork for most of the time but , from the waist upwards through the body , <head>arms</head> and head , he tried to convey how his performers worked and played in the environment to which they belonged . for example :  in Napoli  they were Italian ,  in Far from Denmark  they were Danes influenced by the dance of South America .  This way of creating more plebeian characters is fully demonstrated in Ashton 's  comic masterpiece La Fille Mal Garde  ,  where this style of dance is shown in two different aspects ,  the light - hearted yet technically highly expert dancing of Lise and Colas and the comically eccentric work of Alain and the Cock and Hens .

As traditional Italian dances are often sung ,  the performers pose solemnly fur a second or two at the end of each phrase .  This was a feature widely used by nineteenth - century Italian balletmasters and by Bournonville .  But the latter 's pause was often to hold the dancers in perfect 5th positions of both <head>arms</head> and feet .

Spanish style  The stereotyped Spanish style is possibly seen at its best in Petipa 's  Don Quixote  ,  most particularly in the famous pas de deux  fur the ballerina and her partner .  The tone is set by the continual use of the pose with head held high , back slightly arched , <head>arms</head> in closed 4th or a stretch fully upwards in 5th sur les pointes for Kitri or on demi - pointes for Basil . The brilliant bravura variation when Kitri springs lightly forwards sur les  pointes  whilst fanning herself and Basil attempts to make his zapateado  ( heel - tapping )  appear authentic by the slightly crouching pose of his body ,  add even greater panache to their efforts .  Swanhilda strikes similar poses with her mantilla and fan in Copplia  and so do the Spanish dancers in Swan Lake  .

The working leg is thrust outwards on the first beat of a bar ,  heels click and stamp to accent the appropriate beats .  Although the solo danseuses  perform sur les pointes  ,  they still mark the appropriate beats by stabbing their toes into the floor ,  i.e. they dance a series of retirs passs  forwards or backwards without descending and use typical Hungarian ports de bras  .  These are also strongly accented as the <head>arms</head> straighten into 2nd position before being bent , with hands sometimes clasped behind the head , sometimes placed akimbo on the waist or sometimes with one on the waist and the other behind the large bow at the back of the head - dress . The danseuses  perform some of the traditional steps such as the sideways moving pas de bourre  danced sur les pointes  and the sideways cabrioie  rarely used in classical ballet .   The unusual feature of traditional Hungarian style is the strong distinction made between the two parts of most folk dances .

This made the dancers appear as if they were a moving frieze .  Something that David Bintley was also to achieve later in his Sons of Horus   ( 1985 )  .  Ashton too has created two oriental styled ballets in which the delicacy of the hands and <head>arms</head> drew attention to the way such subtle movements can take the place of words . His interest in ports de bras  nearly always produces something new to say ,  whether it is to tell a story ,  describe the characters and/or create a style exclusive to one work .

In La Fille Mal Garde Mother Simone does this when she triumphantly finishes her Clog Dance on the <head>arms</head> of her more graceful neighbours , just as all the guests but Alain do after the Betrothal and they all dance out , arms linked to celebrate . The gestures of such pastoral characters as Lise and Colas in La Fille Mal Garde  have already been noted  (  - see page 100 )  as well as that of Lise churning and helping her Mother to spin .

Fokine 's  advice to those wishing to create the romantic style of dance was much as fur demi - caractre  when he said :  The choreographer should base his design on classical technique from the feet to the waist ,  but above that the dancer 's  head ,  body and arms must be free to express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the character in the story or theme to be communicated .  This style was first created by Taglioni for his daughter Marie .  The tale of La Sylphide gave him an opportunity to exploit her expressive <head>arms</head> and face as well as her ability to dance sur les pointes . Perrot developed the style in his dances fur Carlotta Grisi in Giselle  .  It was then expanded by Fokine and used in both grave and gay moods in Les Sylphides  and Le Carnaval  ,  where it is particularly expressive of both meaning and music .

Ondine ,  the sea nymph  ( Margot Fonteyn )  so used her feet that she appeared always to float through water .  This was done by a series of pas marchs  each of which softly rose and fell through her feet from toe to heel .  They were co - ordinated with a soft undulating movement of the <head>arms</head> . Ashton thus created a special style fur a particular character which summed up  as it were  her whole being ,  but which would have been unsuitable for any other ballet .  B  Once Fokine had demonstrated that mimed dance and danced mime were the best materials to use in ballets where individual characters had to stand out from the rest of the cast ,  and particularly when true love did not run smoothly ,  other choreographers .  followed suit .

If choreographers study the above works of Ashton and MacMillan ,  they will understand how far the art of choreography has developed since Fokine changed its structure and texture .  They will perhaps understand even better if they pay particular attention to the fine details of every movement .  It is no longer the case that the romantic style means dancing classically from the feet to the waist and above that allowing the body , <head>arms</head> and head to express themselves to describe the moods , emotions and actions of the characters . It is well known that only a great dancer - artist can suggest the development of the sixteen - year - old Aurora ,  happy at her birthday ,  into the dreamy figure the Prince meets in the woodland glade and on to her final entrance as a triumphant princess fully awake to her responsibilities as Queen - to - be .  The enchanements  she dances  thoughout  the three scenes do not change in style or content .

Yet if the dances of Vera and Natalia in A Month in the Country  and Juliet in Romeo and Juliet  are examined it will be discovered how the technical content is so designed that the steps ,  poses and gestures show how changing circumstances are affecting the individuals .  This is what Perrot first attempted with his five leitmotifs for Giselle   ( see page 61 )  .  Continual development in the choreographic design is very obvious in the quiver of the raised leg as the Tutor takes Natalia in his <head>arms</head> . It shows her growing emotional involvement and gradually seems to affect her every movement .  This same tiny movement also appears when Vera begins to dance with the Tutor ,  but her movement is not so intense .

Juliet then becomes the slightly apprehensive debutante at the Ball where her movements ,  though tentative ,   are conventionally correct when she dances with Paris .  The moment she encounters Romeo and senses somehow that her life has changed her movement becomes more purposeful .  From there onwards it becomes stronger and more emotional so that her joyous movements and later abandon in Romeo 's <head>arms</head> are in absolute contrast to her later dance with Paris . Her movements then are equally purposeful but they are constricted and withdrawn ,  so that her father 's  contemptuous rejection of her pleas and his throwing her to the floor seem the proper outcome of what in his eyes is sheer disobedience .  It is her final passionate abandon on discovering Romeo 's  body that demonstrates how overwhelming sorrow can destroy all sense of discipline over both body and mind .

Bodies should be fully stretched upwards and curved either slightly forwards or backwards from the waist only .  This stance must be accompanied by the wellrecognised ports de bras  ,  which must be accurately co - ordinated with the footwork .  The <head>arms</head> usually change after each brief enchanement . Their movement also depends upon which foot is in front .  If the right foot remains there for several bars ,  the arms will be held still ,  but as soon as the left moves in front the arms will change .

By so phrasing each paragraph and bringing each incident to a proper conclusion ,  Nijinska gives both dancers and audience time to consider what has been done and what is yet to happen .  The nature of the formal shapes made by the dancers '  bodies and limbs as they move into and hold a picture must be evaluated .  Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints , thus the dancers ' bodies mostly face the audience but their <head>arms</head> and legs turn inwards and are seen mostly in profile . The angles made at the elbows ,  shoulders ,  knees and ankle joints are clearly visible .  Those of the arms are particularly interesting because the fists are either clenched or the fingers flattened thus the lines and shapes made only appear slightly rounded by the folds in the sleeves .

Technical characteristics It is the very particular choreographic style that MacMillan created for the child - like figure in Requiem  that emphasises more strongly than any other of today 's  ballets the need for choreographers to explore dance itself .  Only when they have examined what hands , <head>arms</head> , legs and feet , body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story , theme or music , can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture , with the right quality , mood , emotion , action and character . The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and ,  when needed ,  help to create the atmosphere and mood of the whole .  Choreographers must then decide how many and which details they need to add to disclose the particular features of the story ,  theme and/or music that they wish to communicate .

Furthermore ,  it can be done in a language with which many EW  + WW  readers will be totally familiar .  However , the same little collection of components would n't allow a robot <head>arm</head> to interpret the signals from a CCD sensor in a manner which allows the arm to be placed reliably alongside an item on a conveyor belt . And if the robot control function requires a signal filter ,  it would seem sensible to incorporate the filter block as part of the DSP recognition software rather than reach for discrete analogue components .  The same arguments for use of digital electronics apply equally to communications systems ,  test and measurement ,  broadcasting and consumer electronics .

For many circuits ,  practical values will need to be derived by scaling :  but be cautious about accuracy .  There is no problem with comparators fed from voltage references .  But in many circuits , significant source and load resistances will need factoring out from the upper and lower <head>arm</head> values respectively ( and scaled pro - rata ) , otherwise the implied accuracy will be false ) . Also rounding errors can affect cases where extreme accuracy is required .  It also performs Wye - Delta transformations  ( handy for network analysis simplification )  and defined multi - tap dividers ,  for up to ten output voltages .

New  Eros  carried as it is on an elaborately established sobbing and languorous rhythm ,  the word new denies itself .  How can the erotic stirring for Aeneas be new ,  when it is explicitly saturated with sentiment for the old ,  the dead ,  for Sicheus ?  Dido 's sobbing for her old lover even as she lies in the <head>arms</head> of her new one this melancholy , which Virgil , and following him Hardy , responded to with such sympathy , is for Pound deathly , it precludes the genuinely new , which he urgently wants to find and to celebrate . The Canto as a whole ,  whatever its incidental obscurities ,  is plainly concerned with the phenomenon of the living dead ,  focussed in part ,  as Ronald Bush has invaluably pointed out ,  on the old men ,  Clemenceau ,  Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson ,  legislating at Versailles for a future they had no part in .  ( They were thus represented in Maynard Keynes '  Economic Consequences of the  Peace  ,  which Pound had read by 1920 .  )

Virgin last night refused to comment ,  but estimates are that the deal could be worth well in excess of 50m ,  making it one of the largest investments by a Japanese organisation in a UK company .

In August the Virgin Group sold its film and video distribution <head>arm</head> , Virgin Vision , to Management Company Entertainment in the US . But in spite of clear signals from Virgin Records that it wants to remain independent ,  speculation was rife that the purchaser might be Sony .

If the Goddess of Democracy symbolised a vision of China alien to the Communist Party ,  the new figures are equally alien to the students :  the obedience of the intellectual and unflinching solidarity of the workers ,  peasants and soldiers .  Ironically ,  neither of these visions is Chinese .  While the students looked to the West , China 's hardline leadership has found its inspiration in the pre - glasnost Soviet Union of Stalinist aesthetics - muscular <head>arms</head> , square jaws and stiff poses . The official blurb explains that the plaster figures stand as if boldly forging ahead ,  their eyes fixed on our motherland 's  beautiful future .  Perhaps unwittingly ,  the new statue hints at a deeper truth underpinning the hardline triumph :  the worker ,  the peasant and the intellectual gaze wistfully towards the Forbidden City ,  the grandest monument to the genius of Chinese civilisation ,  but the soldier has his eyes fixed in a different direction  down the Avenue of Eternal Peace towards Zhongnanhai ,  the walled compound where party leaders live and work .

The price tag of almost 100m ,  and the fact that Fuji has agreed to a minority stake ,  has clearly also provided Mr Branson with reassurance  if he needed any  that taking Virgin private last year was the right thing to do .  Virgin paid 248m last year to remove the group from the scrutiny of the City ,  saying the business was misunderstood and the stock undervalued .  Less than a year later , Fuji seems more than willing to pay 100m for a minority share in the music <head>arm</head> which , with sales of 260m , represents much less than half of the Virgin empire . What remains a mystery is how Virgin would have fared had its directors decided to weather the storms in the stock market .

As a young doctor in Leiden he paid a seminal visit to the neuroanatomist WJH Nauta ,  at that time developing a revolutionary anatomical technique for investigating the nervous system by staining degenerating fibres cut off from their parent cell - bodies .  Kuypers was the first to use this technique in studies of the brain and over the next 10 years ,  now in the United States ,  he charted at a new level of detail the connections made by the cerebral cortex with nervous elements in the brain - stem and spinal cord that control movement in a number of higher mammals .  Kuypers then started a long series of collaborative studies in which injuries to some of these connections in the monkey 's brain were correlated with the defects they produced in performance of movements ; the poising of an <head>arm</head> , for instance , to carry out an operation with the fingers could be dissociated from the ability to use the fingers skilfully . These studies continued ,  with increasing sophistication ,  after his return to Europe in 1966 as Professor of Anatomy at the new Erasmus University in Rotterdam .  He showed that injury to connections within the cerebral cortex could cause the dissociation of hand movements guided by vision from those guided by touch .

Police tried to pull away refugees climbing over the embassy 's  back fence last night ,  but they moved aside when the West German ambassador ,  Hermann Huber ,  appeared in the garden and said :  Let them go !

As dawn broke yesterday , the same group , this time led by a mother with a baby in <head>arms</head> , faced down the police patrols and reached the embassy successfully . On Sunday West Germany had complained about the police presence around its embassy ,  and the slackening of restrictions is thought to have reflected an apparent Czechoslovak desire to remain as far as possible on good terms with both Germanies .  West Germany has so far denied ,  although with a detectable degree of ambiguity ,  that any deal was made ,  preferring to point to the humanitarian reasons for allowing an evacuation of the embassy ,  and the pressure supposedly exerted on East Germany by the Soviet Union to bring the occupation to a speedy end .

Although the Royal Ballet has acquired a certain Russian expansiveness for this production ,  Kirov - trained Asylnuratova simply recasts the ballet with the fierce lucidity of her movement .  The plot 's  dramatic excesses ,  which can be comically absurd ,  take on a brief reality as she dances .  Other Nikiyas Durante or Guillem may for instance assume a charming Oriental fluidity in their <head>arms</head> , but only Asylnuratova 's urgency and amplitude of gesture can convey the destructive extremes of Nikiya 's nature . Only she can phrase her movement so that its rhythm speaks so legibly of high spirits or despair .  And if Asylnuratova does not possess the imperturbable technique of a Guillem ,  the expressiveness of her dancing is matched by so mobile and luminous a face that everyone else on stage looks slightly blank .

Third ,  Labour can now proceed to dismantle the block votes of the trade unions confident that these are no longer needed to keep the party sane .

Their public defence is that the system brought together the industrial and political <head>arms</head> of the labour movement : abandon the block vote and you betray Labour 's parentage . Privately ,  however ,  many leading Labour MPs admit that this is a specious argument .  Instead they have used block votes like bulbs of garlic  to keep away the vampires of the left .

For years , China has used a combination of strong <head>arm</head> diplomacy and shrill rhetoric to try to deny the Dalai Lama international recognition as a legitimate representative of Tibet 's aspirations as something other than a part of China .

I enjoy my Stag most when it is loafing along in overdrive  ( the DIY box has longer legs than the automatic )  ,  exhaust burbling as only a twin - pipe V8 can burble .  When there is nothing above your head but the bracing T - bar  fitted as much to provide body rigidity as to anticipate US safety regulations that did not materialise  so much the better .  From February 1973 , all Stags were sold with both hood ( which stows neatly in a lidded well behind the back seats ) and hardtop ( which required two pairs of strong <head>arms</head> to manipulate ) . So heavy and cumbersome is the hardtop ,  which fails to turn the Stag into a refined fixed - head coupe because of atrocious wind whoosh ,  that many have succumbed to rust while lying neglected in the garden ,  incubating snails .  The Stag is not a sports car ,  nor is it especially fast :  any modern GTi hatchback will comfortably outpace it in a sprint from rest to 60mph .

As the pound slid through the important benchmark of DM3 to close at DM2.9737 and lost ground against the dollar ,  most analysts agreed that the Chancellor would resist a further hike in interest rates at least for the duration of the Conservative Party conference ,  and possibly for some weeks to come .

Speculation that its soldiers would attack the town of Pailin on the Thai border has died down ,  as it became clear that to hold Pailin would be more of a liability than an asset .

The calculation is that increased pressure on Hun Sen will force him back to the negotiating table ,  ready to make the dreaded concession :  the inclusion of the Khmer Rouge in a political settlement .

The Chinese want to put pressure on Vietnam , and Peking has made clear that it will continue sending <head>arms</head> until the Vietnamese - installed government of Hun Sen agrees to some form of power - sharing that includes the Khmer Rouge . The Khmer Rouge says it has changed ,  and now supports a free market economy and a multi - party system .

Mr Thomson also said the Government 's  aims of controlling inflation would put pressure on company profits and make a share prices surge in the winter/spring unlikely .

For example ,  on the controversy over the removal of frontier controls ,  Britain 's  Commissioner proposed that controls should be replaced with police and Customs officer powers to check any traveller on suspicion of drugs or terrorist offences .  The Government has been resisting the removal of frontier controls because of anxieties about drugs and illicit <head>arms</head> traffickers .

The locals field one former Test player ,  Madan Lal ,  and although Maninder Singh  last seen being swept to oblivion by Gooch in the Bombay World Cup semi - final  was practising at the England net yesterday ,  he has yet to come to terms with an attack of the yips .  It is a problem which seems curiously common to left - <head>arm</head> spinners , and manifests itself with the bowler either failing to release the ball , or propelling it vertically into the air . It finished  ( as a bowler )  the former Derbyshire player ,  Fred Swarbrook ,  who gave up the unequal struggle when ,  peering frantically around to see where a delivery had gone ,  he found out only when the ball dropped out of the stratosphere and hit him on top of the head .  All three of England 's  players who did not play against the Railways on Wednesday  Gladstone Small ,  Eddie Hemmings and Alec Stewart  get a game today ,  although there is a slight doubt about Phillip DeFreitas ,  who suffered a reaction to an elbow injury sustained during fielding practice .

The Army ordered sentries to wear flak jackets and constructed many sandbagged emplacements ,  although most barracks were still protected by little more than chain link fences .  The IRA did not choose to attack again until March 1987 .  A possible reason is that it was difficult to get <head>arms</head> and ammunition to the right place , despite the virtual absence of border controls between Germany and its western neighbours . Communication with an active service unit  two to 10 terrorists  far from Ireland was a further obstacle .  Another reason could be that the IRA had become aware of British intelligence 's  drive for informers .

He added :  I was never engaged either in supplying or use of explosives or arms .  That was never part of my business or intention .  At no time did I supply money for <head>arms</head> . Asked if he intended resuming his duties with the Pallotine order ,  the Catholic missionary body he joined in 1954 ,  he said his position had not yet been clarified .  Eamon O'Neill ,  Mr Ryan 's  agent in the June European elections ,  chaired the meeting .

Mr Ryan also admitted buying hundreds of Swiss memopark timing devices in the 1970s .  The devices are designed for parking meters ,  but are also the main timers used in IRA bombs .  The programme alleged that an electronic device bought by Mr Ryan was found in bomb - making circuitry in an IRA <head>arms</head> cache discovered in Salcey Forest , on the Northamptonshire - Buckinghamshire border , in 1984 . Identical circuitry was used in the 1982 Hyde Park bomb which killed eight people and injured fifty - three others .  Untransmitted tapes of the interview with Mr Ryan were handed over by Thames to Scotland Yard under the Prevention of Terrorism  ( Temporary Provisions )  Act 1989 .

With respect to the latter ,  for example ,  women are no longer excluded from night duty and they perform a wider range of section duties than before .  However ,  ordinary policewomen tend to feel that there are constraints upon equal opportunities within the force .  Some of these are official , in that senior managers do not allow policewomen to carry <head>arms</head> , from which follows some restrictions on where policewomen cam be stationed , and on their involvement in high - profile political policing , such as at riots . Most of the constraints ,  however ,  are informal .  With relatively so few policewomen ,  the occupational culture of the force is heavily masculine ,  and the wider cultural values that exist in Northern Ireland generally make men more conservative in their attitudes towards gender and sex roles .

It 's  a desperate way to look at it but when you go out there 's  16 soldiers to every 2 policemen and you work out the odds ,  and that 's  8 to 1 against you being hit .  It 's  awful ,  but that 's  the way your mind works Like , I know guys who lost <head>arms</head> and legs See ,  now I deliberately sit ,  when I 'm out in a Land Rover ,  with one arm up a bit higher than the other and one leg a bit higher .  Like ,  I suppose that way if I was hit I might stand a chance of only losing one arm or one leg .

( FN 15/5/1987 ,  p. 1516 )  As intimated ,  the danger of attack means that two neighbourhood men walking their beat are accompanied by at least sixteen soldiers ,  sometimes also by another squad of soldiers providing cover for those who are protecting the police ,  by two or more Land Rovers from the British Army and the RUC ,  and an Army helicopter .

I lay there for what seemed like an eternity and feeling in a sort of panic .  Was I wounded ?  Had I lost an <head>arm</head> or leg ? I was now able to breathe properly and started to feel over my body with both hands .  I was all right .

As I entered the barn someone handed me a mess - tin full of hot tea .  I sat down on the straw and looked around .  A few feet away two medics were lying stretched out on the floor of the barn , one lying face down , his <head>arms</head> by his sides , he appeared to be dead . No ,  they are not dead ,  Piper .  The poor bastards are exhausted !

As I lay in the ditch I was suddenly conscious of a very strong indescribably sickly smell .  Raising myself on one hand to peer over the ditch before clambering out onto the road ,  my hand and forearm suddenly went through the soft earth up to the elbow .  As I pulled my <head>arm</head> out there was a rush of foul - smelling air ; my hand and arm covered with a green and black substance . I felt a strong feeling of nausea as I realised that I had put my hand through the chest of a dead British soldier that could have been lying in the ditch for several days. The body had been covered by a thin layer of soil as was the practice when a soldier was killed in action and there was no time to move him to the rear .
