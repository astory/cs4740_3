Still ,  by reading ,  and looking at Lee Krasner 's  pictures in New York galleries ,  she was able to defend an independent liking for her SoHo artist .  In London , it was a rather different story , since the literature available needed discrimination , much of it being historical and iconographic , establishing data of little <head>interest</head> to the art student . To her surprise ,  there proved to be perceptive judgements about qualities in Michelangelo 's  work ,  almost hidden in catalogue entries ;  more than one art historian ,  apparently ,  was not only learned but had an eye .

A further ,  and rather extreme way of dealing with a chronological survey of art is to eliminate the artists .  Art history without names was a phrase used by Heinrich Wlflinn ,  in his introduction to The Principles of Art History  first published in 1915 .  Wlflinn was Burckhardt 's successor as professor at Basel , but his later successful career took him to Berlin , Munich and Zrich , a major art historian whose <head>interests</head> were primarily in the Renaissance and the Baroque . Wlflinn was naturally not ignorant  of artists ,  but the famous phrase indicated an interest in the sequence of art seen as forms which develop as if of their own volition .  Wlflinn 's  writings are strong on observation ;  this can be understood from his choice of terms to describe tendencies in form ;  linear as against painterly ,  plane surface as against recessional depth ,  closed against open form ,  composite clarity against fused clarity ,  or absolute clarity against relative clarity .

The reader can beware of an element of self - <head>interest</head> in such anthologies , whether in the form of books or exhibitions .

Animals make up a category of painting with an uneven reputation , though the theme is one of obvious importance and <head>interest</head> in sculpture . Animal Painting in Britain  was the title of a book by Basil Taylor ,  where he explained in his first chapter that the topic had been neglected since it was either assumed to be about sporting pictures ,  or about pictures of horses by such specialists as Sartorius .  He quoted the dismissive comment of the writer of the volume on British Painting 15301790  in the Pelican History of Art  :  To discuss the Sartorius tribe and such painters is no business of the historian of art ,  no matter how bitter the accusations of neglect are wont to be from those specialist writers who sometimes confuse the history of art with praising famous horses .

The Hudson memorial is not widely known ,  but the scope of this monograph is exemplary .  Similar treatment can be found in works on great monuments and schemes ,  perhaps especially in the Italian Renaissance ,  when such projects as the Sistine Chapel or Tintoretto 's  Scuola di San Rocco achieved a personal artistic unity of the highest standard .  for art historians , incomplete schemes or dismembered works such as altarpieces have the attraction of needing detective work ; but a critic takes an <head>interest</head> in a reconstruction only if it throws new light on surviving art . The main strength of this sort of monograph is its potential for detailed interpretation .  As a book on a single subject ,  there is a good chance that the need for description will be reduced by extensive illustration ,  while a favourable judgement on the work has already been implied by the choice of the subject for a monograph .

The collaboration of artists with the stage was also brought to a high point by Serge Diaghilev ,  in his commissions to artists for the Russian Ballet .

Critics no less than artists have wide <head>interests</head> in the arts , and may introduce comparisons in their interpretations . In the nineteenth century to say that a picture was poetic was a common term of praise .  In the present century emphasis on formal qualities in the visual arts have made musical comparisons more frequent ,  emphasised by the use by artists of musical terminology ,  as when Kandinsky chose to call his works Improvisations and Compositions .

In marketing a sale of rather little - known works ,  too ,  there may be some explanatory text .

The process was assisted in the North by the self - exclusion of Britain from internal Ulster affairs by setting up the Stormont parliament which survived from 1922 to 1972 .

The Northern Ireland statelet was founded on an alliance between the protestant loyalists of Ulster and British imperial and capital <head>interests</head> , particularly as represented by the conservative party .

At least up to 1985 ,  the British government submitted to the threat of violence from the loyalist community and accepted the protestant  loyalist veto on any change in the constitutional structure of their state .  With the Anglo - Irish Agreement at Hillsborough in 1985 ,  it has sought to lay aside that veto ,  and establish in principle its political right to modify the structure of power and control in Ulster by involving the Republic of Ireland in a common policy on security .  However , in the <head>interests</head> of Western European stability and its own financial position , the British government is perhaps still putting off the final offer either British withdrawal or some form of power - sharing with catholic nationalists in the hope of loyalists coming round to what is seen as a more reasonable position . The class structure of Northern Ireland is predictably dominated by protestants .  Of course ,  with the development of international monopoly capital and multinational companies ,  additional sources of power have been brought into play .

Their small church membership of around 10,000 hides the wider appeal Paisleyite politics has for the small businessmen and farmers of protestant Ulster .  The setting up of a new form of Ulster Club organization involving paramilitary activity in the wake of the Anglo - Irish accord of 1985 ,  is an added dimension to the struggle for power within the alliance .  It is likely that the inner core of local church laity , such as select vestry members of the Church of Ireland and presbyterian elders , provided and still provide one of the links between the material and spiritual <head>interests</head> of the groups in the alliance , as these laity were and are active in the business and commercial fields also . THE DOMINANT BELIEFS OF THE TWO ALLIANCES As we examine the dominant beliefs of the two alliances ,  it must be stressed that we are not looking at beliefs possessed by each and every person who identifies to a greater or lesser extent with either set of traditions .

Added upset came in the same year from a speech by Dr W. Starkie ,  the commissioner of National Education in Ireland ,  who attacked school managers for not being up to their job .  The attack was within the context of a speech largely praising the Roman catholic church in Ireland .  But the church 's clerics still took offence , particularly at the point that local people should be encouraged to take an <head>interest</head> in the schools by having some financial responsibility for them through local government . As priests controlled the local school directly ,  this was seen to be a direct attack on their role in the school system .  Eventually the Irish party was forced to return to Westminster to see to it that the appropriate denominational interests in England were strengthened and to show the Irish political leadership 's  compliance with the similarly organized Irish system  ( Miller 1973 :  7785 )  .

The bishops were successful in urging the Irish party to accept the church 's  programme for Irish education as a whole .  Their success was founded on a dual strategy .  On the one hand they subscribed to the annual Irish parliamentary party fund and , on the other , they publicly praised the Irish party as the true political representatives of the Irish people and its <head>interests</head> in the British parliament . Even a Castle bishop such as Archbishop Healy ,  now announced his conversion to the nationalist cause .  In other words ,  support for the education policies of the church were the quid  the Irish party had to give in order to obtain the quo  of the bishops '  endorsement of the party as the genuine political representatives of the Irish people or nation .

The total of those favouring denominational schooling in the initial survey was less than one - third .

Alternatively ,  from another perspective ,  the clergy had acted to preserve the old divisions .  Unfortunately ,  the one is an inevitable corollary of the other.

That two dozen of these interiors are in buildings statutorily listed for their special architectural or historic <head>interest</head> say much for the low regard paid to pubs in the exercise of listed building control and indeed for the listing process itself .

History ,  indeed ,  tends to show that public intervention can have the effect of reinforcing rather than curbing market excesses .  It was the licensing system and licensing controls ,  after all ,  which helped to foster Britain 's  peculiar brewery tie and concentrate pub ownership in the hands of the brewers in the first place ;  and it was the same system which connived at and partly encouraged the modern contagion of open - plan pub designs .  In addition , the 1989 MMC Report , conceived as an attack in the public <head>interest</head> on the monopoly power of the major brewers and requiring the untying of large chunks of their tied estates , may have devastating consequences for traditional pubs . For despite their other shortcomings ,  most of the major brewers have been able and willing to cross - subsidise many less profitable houses .  Equally ,  the brewery - tie system has sheltered much pub property in tied tenancies from the harsh winds of the Market .

Her ale ,  if new ,  looks like a misty morning ,  all thick  .  During the 20th century an historic architectural character  perhaps most typically that of the timber framed building  has become popular with ,  and desirable to ,  both publicans and brewers .  In many cases this has resulted in the introduction of faked features and the associated destruction of existing features which , though often of architectural and historic <head>interest</head> in their own right , do not fit in with the designer 's concept of the pub 's ideal form . Artificial plastic beams are frequently introduced ,  ceilings are stripped of plaster to reveal floor joists that were never intended to be seen ,  other timbers are artificially blackened to create a supposedly traditional though in fact inauthentic black and white effect and render or plaster is removed from walls to produce rustic charm .  At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .

Although the loss of the original front is regrettable ,  the present facade is in accord with the general architectural character of the street and retains original late - Georgian features ,  such as its sashes with glazing bars .  The pub 's  owner ,  however ,  wished to remove the 19th century facade and undertake a conjectural restoration of the jetted ,  timber framed front  ( the design of which included various historically inaccurate details )  .  The public clearly believed that this restoration would enhance the building 's <head>interest</head> despite destroying an historic element ; he must also have felt that a new timber framed facade , despite its inauthenticity , would give the pub an historic character that was more readily recognisable and instantly attractive to potential customers . If pub owners were prepared to emphasise the interest of genuine historic features ,  regardless of period ,  then this type of fakery ,  which disappoints or sadly deceives the customer in search of the traditional pub and irreparably removes much of a building 's  interest for future generations ,  could be avoided .

An additional problem faced by many Georgian pubs  particularly historic coaching inns  is the treatment of re - use of stables and other related outbuildings .

Indeed such is the pressure for adequate car parking that there are a surprising number of cases where brewing companies have applied for permission to demolish not only outbuildings but adjacent cottages ,  some of them listed   A number of the larger Georgian pubs originally accommodated outbuildings to the rear .

The multi - roomed and historically - eclectic pub needs to be protected against the ravages of the all - over designer look .  As has been frequently pointed out ,  it is no use providing excellent beer or food if the pub in question has lost all of its charm and atmosphere ;  and surely a multi - roomed pub ,  with a number of differing environments ,  is the best way to serve what is after all always a very diverse and unstandardised community .  In 1976 the Lord Chief Justice , dismissing Bass Charrington 's appeal against a proposal to open up the interior at the Romans Hotel in Southwick , Sussex , declared that it might be undesirable in the public <head>interest</head> to see more public bars disappearing and more mergers of public and saloon bars of the kind in question here In addition ,  far better liaison needs to be established between the breweries and local authority Conservation and Planning Officers ,  English Heritage ,  the National Amenity Societies ,  local civic bodies and ,  of course ,  pub landlords and their clientele over planned pub refurbishments .  In particular ,  licensing magistrates and fire and health authorities should be made more aware of the character and needs of historic buildings .

The inter - war period saw the construction of a large number of new pubs to serve the needs of growing suburban communities and reconstructed city centres .

He mentions dog 's  tooth violets and despite an intensive search ,  I have been unable to find any .  Erythroniums are commonly known as dog 's  tooth violets because their bulbs are curiously shaped and pointed ,  rather like canine teeth .

When students are learning to glide ,  the instructor is not only teaching them the technique of flying a glider ,  but also how to make decisions and judgements in the air .  The final stages of training amount to the handing over of all the responsibility for safety to the student .  Ideally , the student should be making all the decisions and choosing actions in the <head>interests</head> of safety and efficiency . By setting the student problems during the final flights before going solo ,  the instructor can test his ability to think logically and to deal with situations as they arise .  An experienced instructor will stop helping the student at this stage and will refuse to comment until after each flight .

Above all it is vital for every pilot to have the old adage safety first indelibly imprinted on their mind .  In other words ,  if in doubt ,  do n't take a chance .  The mature glider pilot would never hesitate to make a fool of himself in the <head>interests</head> of safety . However ,  it is not just beginners who make mistakes and get caught out .  On one occasion a very experienced pilot in a Nimbus 2 was starting on a car launch when it swung off the runway into a K8 which was some distance ahead .

HO Circular  ( 194/78 )  describing British and American research literature on policing is another typically apologetic ,  anti - intellectual document ,  for within its first few paragraphs it admits :  the implication of attempting to establish a central research information centre to give advice to chief officers about research findings , or collect , collate and distribute research of <head>interest</head> to the police service , and maintain an up - to - date index of research would be very considerable .

For a considerable amount of inconsequential information owned by the institution is classed as confidential , even though its release could only be considered prejudicial to the safety and <head>interests</head> of the state by the most bigoted autocrat . The need to get the retiring member to sign such a document indicates the institutional fear of the outside lying behind the threats which Sir Peter Imbert issued to those who would write controversial memoirs  ( Police Review  ,  26 August 1988 )  ;  for the family demands silence unto death from its members !  And even if an uncommissioned but critical ethnography is not considered to be in breach of the Official Secrets Act ,  it will most likely be construed as structural espionage and lie in breach of the Police Discipline Code as set out in Police Regulations .

Favret - Saada 's  unique analysis  ( ibid .  128 )  of the bizarre subjective position she found herself in is a masterful assessment of the difficulties which arise when the ethnographer seeks to gain  knowledge of a social group which depends for its existence on misknowledge or silence :  For anyone who wants to understand the meaning of such a discourse ,  there is no other solution but to practise it oneself ,  to become one 's  own informant and to try and make explicit what one finds unstatable in oneself .  for it is difficult to see how the native could have any <head>interest</head> in the project of unveiling what can go on existing only if it remains veiled . ( ibid .  22 )  In succumbing to the temptation of subjectivism  ( ibid .  23 )  ,  she recognizes that it becomes impossible to put any distance between oneself and the native ,  or more importantly between oneself and oneself in such a situation .

Philosophy ,  at 70 per cent ,  was significant ;  but he barely squeezed by in Latin ,  taking a refusal at his second attempt and attaining a mere pass at the repeat stage  ( thanks ,  no doubt ,  to his past opting out ,  which necessitated his taking Latin from scratch at university )  .  Zoology ,  the joker in his pack ,  offered in his final year ,  also achieved 62 per cent .  Perhaps the choice was his way of declaring his consuming <head>interest</head> in life , not learning , which was becoming an obsession . Readers of The  Favourite Game will remember Breavman dissecting a frog ,  which arose out of such early experiences ;  they will also remember his tearing up an economics textbook outside a bank on Sherbrooke Street  another reaction to the struggles and disinterest he later recalled .

Pound was a bohemian figure ,  despite his Quaker origins ,  who espoused an anti - credit economic philosophy which thrust him into anti - Semitism .  Leonard found this hard to stomach ,  and frequently expressed himself vehemently against his professor 's  defences of the founder of Imagism  ( which advocated free rhythm as well as concreteness of expression in poetry )  ;  and against his disdainful ,  if teasing ,  comments of those who came from Westmount .  Nevertheless , Leonard was to learn much from the Pennsylvanian , who helped to inspire his <head>interest</head> in Eastern thought , not least through his translations of the Chinese poet Li Po .

Here is Piaget 's  most well - known demonstration of the infant 's  failure to relate actions to experiences .  At about seven months of age the average baby is quite skilled at removing obstacles to prehension ;  is well able ,  for example ,  to pull a cushion away to reach a rattle behind it .  However , if the rattle slips down so far that it is no longer visible , the infant will at once lose <head>interest</head> and behave as if the rattle had also slipped out of existence . By about eight months of age most infants are capable of retrieving completely hidden objects ;  but between eight and twelve months they show another intriguing pattern of errors .  There are now two occluders ,  A and B ,  side - by - side before the infant .

( This does not ,  unlike the Piagetian methods ,  rely on the baby doing anything intentionally  such as reaching .  It allows the psychologist to determine whether the subject has detected a change in a stimulus or can discriminate between two stimuli .  )  Initially the subject will attend to a new stimulus but will then gradually lose <head>interest</head> and start to look away ( habituation ) ; if the stimulus is then changed in some way and if this causes a re - awakening of <head>interest</head> ( dishabituation ) then we can assume that the baby has detected the change . Another technique is preferential looking .  If the subject prefers to look at one stimulus rather than another we can assume that he has detected a difference between them .

The notebooks show Svidrigailov developing from a minor into a major character while Crime and Punishment  was being planned and written ,  and they show his growth as interdependent with Raskolnikov 's  final definition .

He appears to lose <head>interest</head> in life . He is bored .

At the same time ,  there is an ambiguity in this backwards opening of the canon .  Much of the work that is rediscovered may have the literary qualities that will satisfy readers without particular feminist interests :  the poems by women that Roger Lonsdale included in The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth - Century Verse  are a small - scale ,  easily accessible instance .  Nevertheless , in a feminist academic context writing may well be studied , not primarily for its literary but for its cultural <head>interest</head> . This question provoked arguments in America about the Norton Anthology of Literature by Women  ,  some of the contents of which were said to have had little value as literature .

Non - evaluative criticism ,  as propounded by the successive Merton professors ,  Gardner and Carey ,  has long been a popular ideal at Oxford .  But another Oxford professor ,  John Bayley ,  sees things differently .  Discussing a book on Dostoevsky , he remarks that while the author has much of <head>interest</head> to say about The Idiot she does not quite persuade one that it comes off , indeed she does not really try , because like many scholars today she is more concerned with showing how the thing works than with judging if it works well . From the beginning academic literary study was divided between those who saw it as inevitably involved with making judgements and those who did not. Cambridge English represented the former :  Richards and Leavis wanted an evaluative criticism ,  because they did not believe that literature was simply a matter of disinterested individual response ;  it was an index to the condition of civilization ,  which made judgements imperative .

Venturing to propound a law of intellectual life ,  I suggest that evaluative criticism enters institutional literary study under the influence of practising writers ,  or of critics who have a close discipular relation to them ,  but that in time it is rejected ,  like an alien organ .  Writers ,  whose criticism arises directly from the problems and possibilities of their art ,  are inevitably evaluative ;  Baudelaire showed how being a poet also involves being a critic .  Eliot 's early and best criticism was what he called workshop criticism , an attempt to realign literary tradition in the <head>interests</head> of the kind of poetry he wanted to write . Leavis ,  at the beginning of his career a whole - hearted admirer of Eliot ,  took over Eliot 's  tentative critical models and systematized them .  Later he responded in a similar way to D. H.

What better inspiration could a literature of theory have than an audience composed of theorists and critics ?  This is not ,  I think ,  meant to be ironical ,  and it represents a quite logical development from the premiss that the whole production ,  definition ,  and reception of literature has now become intramural to the academy .  In this context , what goes on outside , what is actually written by poets and novelists , is of minor <head>interest</head> .

An awkward truth though is that in the twentieth century some of the most committed political criticism has come from conservatives ,  like Eliot and the Southern Agrarians .  An erudite work by an Oxford New Historicist ,  David Norbrook 's  Poetry and Politics in the English Renaissance  ,  illustrates the structuralist truism that in a binary grouping one of the two terms tends to assume dominance .  Norbrook 's <head>interest</head> is clearly far more in politics than in poetry . The most significant aspect of the New Historicism ,  political questions apart ,  is that it represents a move away from the contextless ,  intensive concentration on particular texts equally characteristic of the New Criticism ,  classical structuralism ,  and deconstruction .  This has major pedagogic implications ,  since students can no longer hope to make sense of poems or plays just by reading them carefully ,  but must spend time in libraries getting up on the historical context .

Granted that there is an absolute need for humanistic values to prevail in a neo - utilitarian and materialistic age ,  one is faced with a significant divergence in the nature of these values .

It is the business of the head of the established church to express his worries about the state of the nation and the moral mood of the times .

If Dr Runcie sees self - <head>interest</head> , self - righteousness and an intolerant and uncharitable disregard for the unsuccessful and the unemployed , it is not merely his right but his duty to speak out . If ,  further ,  he feels that the free market policies and values embraced by Mrs Thatcher have done much to create a divided nation ,  dominated by Pharisees ,  he should feel free to offer his opinion .  This is not ,  however ,  to say that Dr Runcie is correct .

Signalling the beginning of a lower - key campaign against the plans of the Lord Chancellor ,  Lord Mackay of Clashfern ,  to give increased rights of audience in the High and Crown court to solicitors ,  Lord Donaldson called on the Bar to put aside the trauma ,  the acrimony and the recriminations which followed Lord Mackay 's  Green Papers and to abandon the hustings .  Lord Donaldson said objectives due to be included in this autumn 's  Bill were total freedom of choice for the client ,  unless the interests of justice otherwise require .  When those concerned turn their attention to this problem , they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public <head>interest</head> in the result and that in which the public <head>interest</head> is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available . In the first category we have criminal cases ,  judicial review and cases which involve matrimonial status and the welfare of children or those under a disability .  In many of them ,  particularly criminal cases ,  the interests of the client may be quite different from those of the public .

But on the other hand ,  the statute will also include a clear intention that extended rights of audience are put into practical effect as soon as the necessary conditions have been met .

They should also be given permission to issue some form of fixed <head>interest</head> profit - related bond , be allowed to raise a proportion of their equity direct from the public and be subject to independent regulation similar to that of privatised utilities .

This inevitably leads to a climate in which the likelihood of giving not only money but also one 's  time is reduced .

It is shrewd of Mr Kinnock to attempt to enlist this mood and to link Labour with such concepts as patriotism ,  efficiency and plain common sense ,  virtues which have more often been associated with the Conservative Party. Similarly ,  it is shrewd of him to play for the internationalist vote after a prolonged period of sullen Little Englandism during which Labour threatened to withdraw from the Common Market and called into question this country 's  role within Nato .  Increasingly the Prime Minister is regarded by many swing voters as unconstructive and isolationist rather than a determined defender of British <head>interests</head> . She ,  and not Mr Kinnock ,  is constantly at odds with the European Community and the Commonwealth .  A stance which was appropriate for the Age of Brezhnev and Galtieri now seems out of date and out of touch with the spirit of the times .

There is no question here of the swing of the pendulum .  It is rather comforting in a way .  Chesterton said that tradition is the democracy of the dead but in France the dead get a seat in parliament , together with three secretaries each , <head>interest</head> - free loans , subsidised foreign travel and an income of about 40,000 , half of which is tax free . Those who attack the Senate say that it should be abolished ,  that it is useless and corrupt .  Those who defend it say that it repesents an area of moderation and wisdom in French democracy and that both are sorely needed .

' Serjeant sustained his increasingly serious illness with signal fortitude and uproarious humour .

He had a passionate <head>interest</head> in music and opera which led him to design several operatic sets .

DAVID KING ,  King of the Castle ,  was one of the great authorities on the medieval castle and author of a definitive catalogue of all castles built in England and Wales .  Born in 1913 ,  he was educated at Clifton College and went on to read law at Bristol University .  His service in the Royal Artillery in the Second World War took him to the Middle East , and there he was able to develop his <head>interest</head> in military architecture through the study of the citadel at Damascus , and the siege of the crusader castle of Krak des Chevaliers . The results were eventually published after the war .  King lost a leg during war service in Italy ,  an event which makes his thorough surveys of castles ,  notably those in Wales ,  even more remarkable .

For many readers ,  Le Monde 's  view of the world is France 's  view of the world .  That view is presented in a classical French ,  rarely illustrated ,  and then only with the smallest photographs or the occasional line drawing .  It follows an editorial policy that believes foreign news should lead the first three pages , that matters of national <head>interest</head> should be philosophically debated in the newspaper 's columns , and that half a page of sport either side of the weekend is enough . Having survived a financial crisis in the early 1980s ,  thanks to support from the banks and from a staff prepared to agree to a voluntary wage freeze ,  the paper is now making money and putting on readers ,  so why has the management now decided to modernise the title ?  On first sight it might seem a case of plus ca change ,  plus c'est la meme chose .

In a decision which was widely predicted ,  Mr Patten has declared himself minded to uphold the view of the department 's  inspectorate that Consortium Developments ,  representing several of the country 's  major home - builders ,  had not made a sufficiently strong case for the development of 4,800 houses in what is an abandoned quarry and a conifer plantation .  Explaining a new policy drift which will respect local political will at the expense of new development ,  Mr Patten said :  Over the next 10 or 12 years we are going to need substantial numbers of new houses .  At the same time we can expect people 's <head>interest</head> in green issues and concern for their local environment to grow . The decision is part of a much wider shift in government thinking ,  in which Mr Patten has clearly been given Cabinet permission to distance his own policy from that of predecessors ,  such as Michael Heseltine ,  and ,  to a lesser extent ,  Mr Ridley ,  now Trade and Industry Secretary ,  who believed that economic success depended on getting the planner off the backs of business and citizen alike .  Mr Patten yesterday issued a draft housing planning policy guidance note ,  which will update previous documents .

This is pretty low for a speculative investment and assumes the company is capitalised at 12.5 times earnings in the year to 31 March 2017 .

They have fired this interest by spending 44m on the issue ,  aiming it primarily at the retail investor when one might expect an issue of this sort to be more suitable for institutions .

A further ,  and rather extreme way of dealing with a chronological survey of art is to eliminate the artists .  Art history without names was a phrase used by Heinrich Wlflinn ,  in his introduction to The Principles of Art History  first published in 1915 .  Wlflinn was Burckhardt 's successor as professor at Basel , but his later successful career took him to Berlin , Munich and Zrich , a major art historian whose <head>interests</head> were primarily in the Renaissance and the Baroque . Wlflinn was naturally not ignorant  of artists ,  but the famous phrase indicated an interest in the sequence of art seen as forms which develop as if of their own volition .  Wlflinn 's  writings are strong on observation ;  this can be understood from his choice of terms to describe tendencies in form ;  linear as against painterly ,  plane surface as against recessional depth ,  closed against open form ,  composite clarity against fused clarity ,  or absolute clarity against relative clarity .

Animal Painting in Britain  was the title of a book by Basil Taylor ,  where he explained in his first chapter that the topic had been neglected since it was either assumed to be about sporting pictures ,  or about pictures of horses by such specialists as Sartorius .  He quoted the dismissive comment of the writer of the volume on British Painting 15301790  in the Pelican History of Art  :  To discuss the Sartorius tribe and such painters is no business of the historian of art ,  no matter how bitter the accusations of neglect are wont to be from those specialist writers who sometimes confuse the history of art with praising famous horses .

The Hudson memorial is not widely known ,  but the scope of this monograph is exemplary .  Similar treatment can be found in works on great monuments and schemes ,  perhaps especially in the Italian Renaissance ,  when such projects as the Sistine Chapel or Tintoretto 's  Scuola di San Rocco achieved a personal artistic unity of the highest standard .  for art historians , incomplete schemes or dismembered works such as altarpieces have the attraction of needing detective work ; but a critic takes an <head>interest</head> in a reconstruction only if it throws new light on surviving art . The main strength of this sort of monograph is its potential for detailed interpretation .  As a book on a single subject ,  there is a good chance that the need for description will be reduced by extensive illustration ,  while a favourable judgement on the work has already been implied by the choice of the subject for a monograph .

The collaboration of artists with the stage was also brought to a high point by Serge Diaghilev ,  in his commissions to artists for the Russian Ballet .  This connection between painting and the theatre was important to earlier European art in religious as well as secular performances .  Critics no less than artists have wide <head>interests</head> in the arts , and may introduce comparisons in their interpretations . In the nineteenth century to say that a picture was poetic was a common term of praise .  In the present century emphasis on formal qualities in the visual arts have made musical comparisons more frequent ,  emphasised by the use by artists of musical terminology ,  as when Kandinsky chose to call his works Improvisations and Compositions .

Carritt bought it ,  correctly identified it as a lost early work ,  and magnanimously sold it to the National Gallery ,  London ,  far below the market price .  Auction catalogues do not carry critical comments on individual items for sale ,  but there are sometimes introductions with criticism .  An example is the catalogue of paintings by Nol Coward , which was prefaced by a memoir of the playwright , describing his <head>interest</head> in painting . In marketing a sale of rather little - known works ,  too ,  there may be some explanatory text .  It would be wrong to dismiss this sort of criticism as mere sales talk ,  particularly in grand auctioneers '  catalogues ,  though there is little danger of such publications being reticent .

A profile of the artist is another form in which to review an exhibition .  When such an article rises above the level of a gossip column ,  the artist 's  profile can be a valuable format .  One source of <head>interest</head> can be a description of where the interview has taken place , perhaps a studio , or maybe the artist 's home . After the Second World War ,  for example ,  the photographer Alexander Liberman decided to visit the studios of artists who had contributed to a century of painting in France ,  painters and sculptors closely connected with the School of Paris .  He commented on his project :  The more I explored ,  the more I became absorbed with the mystery of the environment .

This distinguished alliance of landscape artists sought to invigorate their country 's  artistic life by bold treatment of wild Canadian subjects .

They subsequently developed individual styles and separate <head>interests</head> , as is true of most groups of artists , but their initial appearance was defined by a programme . Another sort of title for a group is exemplified by Der Blaue Reiter   ( The Blue Rider )  .  Forty - three works by fourteen painters were shown in 1911 at the First Exhibition by the Editorial Board of The Blue Rider  ,  the publication concerned being an almanac which appeared in 1912 with a drawing of a horseman by Kandinsky on the cover .

This aim has a sweepingness and a suspendingness which are apparent ,  too ,  in the novel to which it relates .  Many poems contain a critique of poetry ,  just as many contain a critique of the self - portrayed poet ,  and of his intention to serve a social or doctrinal system ,  or of his claim to be a special case .  The lyric is not generically debarred from standing out against the state , or from taking a generous <head>interest</head> in what goes on in the world .

Roth has left off with his mythologising fury  and his memoir lets us know that the benefits that come to the writer who tries ,  or even seems ,  to stick to the facts may amount to something more than those of hindsight .  It informs us of the forces which shaped Roth 's  tours de force  of the Sixties and early Seventies ,  and it informs us of how he came to be where he is now .  He has travelled from the liberated past , when imagination took power , to the liberation of an <head>interest</head> in fact a state which may or may not prove to have been , for Roth , partial or provisional , and which The Facts , in its totality , manages to enclose in an ironised uncertainty .

But perhaps it will come to be thought by his readers that these successive attitudes to the autobiographical ,  and to plain speaking ,  in art are equally valid ,  equally reversible .

In particular the protestant bloc lost the Southern protestant landowning gentry .

The two societies gave expression to their own dominant <head>interests</head> as far as possible unhindered by each other 's interference . The process was assisted in the North by the self - exclusion of Britain from internal Ulster affairs by setting up the Stormont parliament which survived from 1922 to 1972 .  Protestant  loyalist domination ,  successor to the ascendancy ,  was circumscribed to one corner of Ireland while the catholic  nationalist alliance asserted total domination in the remainder .

While the party contains many who actively seek peace and reconciliation ,  it would be wrong to think of them in any sense as overcoming the basic conflictual components of bloc power in Ireland .  Castle catholics ,  those who found a place in the Stormont administration and developed a stake in the union ,  have also voted alliance ,  but are probably now ,  in 1989 ,  switching their allegiance to the newly found conservative associations ,  which are seeking to bring British party loyalties to Ulster .  The Northern Ireland statelet was founded on an alliance between the protestant loyalists of Ulster and British imperial and capital <head>interests</head> , particularly as represented by the conservative party . But that is what the arrangement was :  an alliance rather than a consolidated interest or a genuinely shared culture .  Protestant loyalists dominated the statelet from its formation .

At least up to 1985 ,  the British government submitted to the threat of violence from the loyalist community and accepted the protestant  loyalist veto on any change in the constitutional structure of their state .  With the Anglo - Irish Agreement at Hillsborough in 1985 ,  it has sought to lay aside that veto ,  and establish in principle its political right to modify the structure of power and control in Ulster by involving the Republic of Ireland in a common policy on security .  However , in the <head>interests</head> of Western European stability and its own financial position , the British government is perhaps still putting off the final offer either British withdrawal or some form of power - sharing with catholic nationalists in the hope of loyalists coming round to what is seen as a more reasonable position . The class structure of Northern Ireland is predictably dominated by protestants .  Of course ,  with the development of international monopoly capital and multinational companies ,  additional sources of power have been brought into play .

Their small church membership of around 10,000 hides the wider appeal Paisleyite politics has for the small businessmen and farmers of protestant Ulster .  The setting up of a new form of Ulster Club organization involving paramilitary activity in the wake of the Anglo - Irish accord of 1985 ,  is an added dimension to the struggle for power within the alliance .  It is likely that the inner core of local church laity , such as select vestry members of the Church of Ireland and presbyterian elders , provided and still provide one of the links between the material and spiritual <head>interests</head> of the groups in the alliance , as these laity were and are active in the business and commercial fields also . THE DOMINANT BELIEFS OF THE TWO ALLIANCES As we examine the dominant beliefs of the two alliances ,  it must be stressed that we are not looking at beliefs possessed by each and every person who identifies to a greater or lesser extent with either set of traditions .

History ,  indeed ,  tends to show that public intervention can have the effect of reinforcing rather than curbing market excesses .  It was the licensing system and licensing controls ,  after all ,  which helped to foster Britain 's  peculiar brewery tie and concentrate pub ownership in the hands of the brewers in the first place ;  and it was the same system which connived at and partly encouraged the modern contagion of open - plan pub designs .  In addition , the 1989 MMC Report , conceived as an attack in the public <head>interest</head> on the monopoly power of the major brewers and requiring the untying of large chunks of their tied estates , may have devastating consequences for traditional pubs . For despite their other shortcomings ,  most of the major brewers have been able and willing to cross - subsidise many less profitable houses .  Equally ,  the brewery - tie system has sheltered much pub property in tied tenancies from the harsh winds of the Market .

Her ale ,  if new ,  looks like a misty morning ,  all thick  .  During the 20th century an historic architectural character  perhaps most typically that of the timber framed building  has become popular with ,  and desirable to ,  both publicans and brewers .  In many cases this has resulted in the introduction of faked features and the associated destruction of existing features which , though often of architectural and historic <head>interest</head> in their own right , do not fit in with the designer 's concept of the pub 's ideal form . Artificial plastic beams are frequently introduced ,  ceilings are stripped of plaster to reveal floor joists that were never intended to be seen ,  other timbers are artificially blackened to create a supposedly traditional though in fact inauthentic black and white effect and render or plaster is removed from walls to produce rustic charm .  At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .

Although the loss of the original front is regrettable ,  the present facade is in accord with the general architectural character of the street and retains original late - Georgian features ,  such as its sashes with glazing bars .  The pub 's  owner ,  however ,  wished to remove the 19th century facade and undertake a conjectural restoration of the jetted ,  timber framed front  ( the design of which included various historically inaccurate details )  .  The public clearly believed that this restoration would enhance the building 's <head>interest</head> despite destroying an historic element ; he must also have felt that a new timber framed facade , despite its inauthenticity , would give the pub an historic character that was more readily recognisable and instantly attractive to potential customers . If pub owners were prepared to emphasise the interest of genuine historic features ,  regardless of period ,  then this type of fakery ,  which disappoints or sadly deceives the customer in search of the traditional pub and irreparably removes much of a building 's  interest for future generations ,  could be avoided .

An additional problem faced by many Georgian pubs  particularly historic coaching inns  is the treatment of re - use of stables and other related outbuildings .  As Matthew Saunders noted in the 1983 SAVE/CAMRA Report :  The freestanding stable wing , the coachmen and ostlers accommodation , the skittle alley and cobbled yard can be of the greatest <head>interest</head> and yet are very vulnerable to the ubiquitous need , often enforced by the planning authorities , for adequate car parking space . Indeed such is the pressure for adequate car parking that there are a surprising number of cases where brewing companies have applied for permission to demolish not only outbuildings but adjacent cottages ,  some of them listed   A number of the larger Georgian pubs originally accommodated outbuildings to the rear .

The multi - roomed and historically - eclectic pub needs to be protected against the ravages of the all - over designer look .  As has been frequently pointed out ,  it is no use providing excellent beer or food if the pub in question has lost all of its charm and atmosphere ;  and surely a multi - roomed pub ,  with a number of differing environments ,  is the best way to serve what is after all always a very diverse and unstandardised community .  In 1976 the Lord Chief Justice , dismissing Bass Charrington 's appeal against a proposal to open up the interior at the Romans Hotel in Southwick , Sussex , declared that it might be undesirable in the public <head>interest</head> to see more public bars disappearing and more mergers of public and saloon bars of the kind in question here In addition ,  far better liaison needs to be established between the breweries and local authority Conservation and Planning Officers ,  English Heritage ,  the National Amenity Societies ,  local civic bodies and ,  of course ,  pub landlords and their clientele over planned pub refurbishments .  In particular ,  licensing magistrates and fire and health authorities should be made more aware of the character and needs of historic buildings .

The inter - war period saw the construction of a large number of new pubs to serve the needs of growing suburban communities and reconstructed city centres .  These usually reflected Tudor or Georgian styles ,  sometimes with intentional accuracy ,  more often in an impressionistic way .  The spread of motoring caused a revival of <head>interest</head> in the tradition of wayside coaching inns , since these were rediscovered as charming nostalgic examples of bygone days , and the charm of the wayside inn was celebrated in the verses of Hilaire Belloc and Rupert Brooke . Running a modern - day coaching inn became a fashionable activity after the painter John Fothergill took on the Spread Eagle at Thame in the 1920s and ,  later ,  the Three Swans at Market Harborough .  A melancholic figure dressed in black ,  he seems to have specialised in overhung jugged hare and insults to his customers .

( ibid .  22 )  In succumbing to the temptation of subjectivism  ( ibid .  23 )  ,  she recognizes that it becomes impossible to put any distance between oneself and the native ,  or more importantly between oneself and oneself in such a situation .

Philosophy ,  at 70 per cent ,  was significant ;  but he barely squeezed by in Latin ,  taking a refusal at his second attempt and attaining a mere pass at the repeat stage  ( thanks ,  no doubt ,  to his past opting out ,  which necessitated his taking Latin from scratch at university )  .  Zoology ,  the joker in his pack ,  offered in his final year ,  also achieved 62 per cent .  Perhaps the choice was his way of declaring his consuming <head>interest</head> in life , not learning , which was becoming an obsession . Readers of The  Favourite Game will remember Breavman dissecting a frog ,  which arose out of such early experiences ;  they will also remember his tearing up an economics textbook outside a bank on Sherbrooke Street  another reaction to the struggles and disinterest he later recalled .  The choices he made ,  and the way his achievements oscillated ,  show a decided lack of conviction ,  or perhaps of direction ,  in his thinking .

Pound was a bohemian figure ,  despite his Quaker origins ,  who espoused an anti - credit economic philosophy which thrust him into anti - Semitism .  Leonard found this hard to stomach ,  and frequently expressed himself vehemently against his professor 's  defences of the founder of Imagism  ( which advocated free rhythm as well as concreteness of expression in poetry )  ;  and against his disdainful ,  if teasing ,  comments of those who came from Westmount .  Nevertheless , Leonard was to learn much from the Pennsylvanian , who helped to inspire his <head>interest</head> in Eastern thought , not least through his translations of the Chinese poet Li Po . I love Pound ,  Leonard said to us late one afternoon .  There are still lines that resound in my mind .

It is almost certain that Leonard 's <head>interest</head> in Zen Buddhism was sown at this time , and his anti - intellectualism confirmed . It was the start of a serious counter - culture which achieved its apogee  in the poetry and antics of Bob Dylan ,  The Beatles ,  The Rolling Stones et al  .  Not so quiet was a parallel revolution that was reshaping the music scene ,  with which Leonard had an ongoing affair .

Here is Piaget 's  most well - known demonstration of the infant 's  failure to relate actions to experiences .  At about seven months of age the average baby is quite skilled at removing obstacles to prehension ;  is well able ,  for example ,  to pull a cushion away to reach a rattle behind it .  However , if the rattle slips down so far that it is no longer visible , the infant will at once lose <head>interest</head> and behave as if the rattle had also slipped out of existence . By about eight months of age most infants are capable of retrieving completely hidden objects ;  but between eight and twelve months they show another intriguing pattern of errors .  There are now two occluders ,  A and B ,  side - by - side before the infant .

( This does not ,  unlike the Piagetian methods ,  rely on the baby doing anything intentionally  such as reaching .  It allows the psychologist to determine whether the subject has detected a change in a stimulus or can discriminate between two stimuli .  )  Initially the subject will attend to a new stimulus but will then gradually lose <head>interest</head> and start to look away ( habituation ) ; if the stimulus is then changed in some way and if this causes a re - awakening of <head>interest</head> ( dishabituation ) then we can assume that the baby has detected the change . Another technique is preferential looking .  If the subject prefers to look at one stimulus rather than another we can assume that he has detected a difference between them .

In Structuralist Poetics  Culler took an unenthusiastic view of deconstructionism ,  but he shortly  returned to the United States and succumbed to the deconstructive wave that swept through the American academy in the late seventies ,  and into which I did not feel inclined to plunge .  David Lodge was another established British academic and writer who took an early interest in formalist and structuralist methods and principles .

Hawkes had dismissed the ideas of objectivity and truth in Structuralism and Semiotics  ,  but Nuttall insists that such dismissals are pragmatically self - refuting .  We may assert that there is no such thing as truth ,  but we regard that as a true statement .  The point has a particular relevance to the work of those who believe , like Foucault , following Nietzsche , that truth is a mere rhetorical device , employed in the <head>interests</head> of oppression , and say so at length . What then is the status of Foucault 's  saying so ?  Nevertheless ,  the very concept of truth seems to be an irritant for some .

The recent revival of <head>interest</head> in psychoanalysis among literary theorists has come from France , and in particular from the work of Jacques Lacan , who brought together Freud and Saussure and produced the slogan , the unconscious is structured like a language .

At the same time ,  there is an ambiguity in this backwards opening of the canon .  Much of the work that is rediscovered may have the literary qualities that will satisfy readers without particular feminist interests :  the poems by women that Roger Lonsdale included in The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth - Century Verse  are a small - scale ,  easily accessible instance .  Nevertheless , in a feminist academic context writing may well be studied , not primarily for its literary but for its cultural <head>interest</head> . This question provoked arguments in America about the Norton Anthology of Literature by Women  ,  some of the contents of which were said to have had little value as literature .

Non - evaluative criticism ,  as propounded by the successive Merton professors ,  Gardner and Carey ,  has long been a popular ideal at Oxford .  But another Oxford professor ,  John Bayley ,  sees things differently .  Discussing a book on Dostoevsky , he remarks that while the author has much of <head>interest</head> to say about The Idiot she does not quite persuade one that it comes off , indeed she does not really try , because like many scholars today she is more concerned with showing how the thing works than with judging if it works well . From the beginning academic literary study was divided between those who saw it as inevitably involved with making judgements and those who did not. Cambridge English represented the former :  Richards and Leavis wanted an evaluative criticism ,  because they did not believe that literature was simply a matter of disinterested individual response ;  it was an index to the condition of civilization ,  which made judgements imperative .

Venturing to propound a law of intellectual life ,  I suggest that evaluative criticism enters institutional literary study under the influence of practising writers ,  or of critics who have a close discipular relation to them ,  but that in time it is rejected ,  like an alien organ .  Writers ,  whose criticism arises directly from the problems and possibilities of their art ,  are inevitably evaluative ;  Baudelaire showed how being a poet also involves being a critic .  Eliot 's early and best criticism was what he called workshop criticism , an attempt to realign literary tradition in the <head>interests</head> of the kind of poetry he wanted to write . Leavis ,  at the beginning of his career a whole - hearted admirer of Eliot ,  took over Eliot 's  tentative critical models and systematized them .  Later he responded in a similar way to D. H. Lawrence 's  criticism ,  as well as to his creative achievement .

What better inspiration could a literature of theory have than an audience composed of theorists and critics ?  This is not ,  I think ,  meant to be ironical ,  and it represents a quite logical development from the premiss that the whole production ,  definition ,  and reception of literature has now become intramural to the academy .  In this context , what goes on outside , what is actually written by poets and novelists , is of minor <head>interest</head> . Paul de Man is reported to have said that a  literary work is merely an event in the history of interpretation .  A natural response to this state of affairs would be to say that theory cut off from the writing of literature is no more than a sterile academicism .

An awkward truth though is that in the twentieth century some of the most committed political criticism has come from conservatives ,  like Eliot and the Southern Agrarians .  An erudite work by an Oxford New Historicist ,  David Norbrook 's  Poetry and Politics in the English Renaissance  ,  illustrates the structuralist truism that in a binary grouping one of the two terms tends to assume dominance .  Norbrook 's <head>interest</head> is clearly far more in politics than in poetry . The most significant aspect of the New Historicism ,  political questions apart ,  is that it represents a move away from the contextless ,  intensive concentration on particular texts equally characteristic of the New Criticism ,  classical structuralism ,  and deconstruction .  This has major pedagogic implications ,  since students can no longer hope to make sense of poems or plays just by reading them carefully ,  but must spend time in libraries getting up on the historical context .

I am very sympathetic to it ,  and have tried to put it into effect in some of my own writing ,  but there is an accompanying danger that literature becomes absorbed by culture ,  and that literary values are superseded by cultural ones .

Granted that there is an absolute need for humanistic values to prevail in a neo - utilitarian and materialistic age ,  one is faced with a significant divergence in the nature of these values .

This is the first visible sign of a shareholders '  revolt against the chairman ,  Sir Derek Alun - Jones ,  since the discovery of a 185m fraud which threatens the group 's  future .  Sir Derek believes he should not be held to blame since the fraud occurred in the accounts of International Signal and Control ,  which had received a clean audit when Ferranti bought the company two years ago. Trustees representing substantial family <head>interests</head> have written to Sir Derek asking for the board to be replaced or supplemented by new directors . It is an accepted practice in dire situations such as this that the board is replaced or supplemented by a new board charged with the function of restoring the fortunes of the company and the confidence of customers ,  the letter says .  You may care to consider whether this is not a practice to be followed in the case of Ferranti .

Basil de Ferranti was chairman of the company until it merged with International Signal and Control ,  a takeover which he supported .  As part of the deal Mr de Ferranti agreed to stand down in favour of Sir Derek and to allow James Guerin ,  International Signal 's  founder ,  to come on to the board as deputy chairman .

A HIGH - POWERED group of finance directors has urged the Government to consider giving greater commercial freedom to nationalised industries such as British Rail and the Post Office rather than privatising them outright .  They should be made to correspond more closely with private sector practice and allowed the freedom to borrow from the market place ,  the group says .  They should also be given permission to issue some form of fixed <head>interest</head> profit - related bond , be allowed to raise a proportion of their equity direct from the public and be subject to independent regulation similar to that of privatised utilities . These are the main recommendations of a report from the Hundred Group of senior British finance directors ,  published yesterday and circulated to ministers and senior civil servants .  At the moment nationalised industries are severely restricted in the way they borrow money .

They accepted limitations on the jurisdiction of Hong Kong 's  post - 1997 Supreme Court ,  and proposals which would diminish the independence of judges .  They refrained from responding to a long series of statements by senior Chinese officials which contradicted both the letter and the spirit of the Joint Declaration - including an assurance , for example , that the post - 1997 Hong Kong press would be free for as long as it did not publish anything detrimental to China 's national <head>interest</head> . London was all too obviously selling Hong Kong down the Pearl River ,  despite its protestations to the contrary .  Even now ,  and though the events of June triggered a brief period of reappraisal ,  the British still seem besotted by their vision of China as a billion - strong market for their goods and services  and either unaware ,  or unimpressed ,  that their exports to Hong Kong itself are currently worth three times as much as those to its northern neighbour .

The party leader ,  Hans - Jochen Vogel ,  a rather uninspiring figure ,  has nonetheless proved adept at managing this delicate evolution which ,  bolder than anything the Labour party ever contemplated ,  has avoided the sort of fratricidal bloodletting which ravaged its British counterpart .  The traditionalist camp has had to swallow some bitter pills .  Oskar Lafontaine , the SPD leader in the Saarland , has argued vociferously that a modern mass party like the SPD could not afford to have its policies confined to the narrow <head>interests</head> of employed industrial workers . In the party 's  new programme ,  the trade unions have had to backtrack on their central demand ,  now accepting that a shorter working week will mean reduced wages .  But Mr Lafontaine ,  standard - bearer of the up - and - coming generation ,  and the second most important figure after Mr Vogel on the committee drafting the party programme for the next decade ,  has certainly not had things all his own way .

Commercial pressures are hostile to the creation of space ,  except in the most limited and functional sense ,  either inside or out .  The ideal interior is neutral and unobstructed ,  while the demand for floor area pushes buildings to the limits of their sites ,  making public spaces ,  or any but the thinnest facades ,  unprofitable .  As the creation of space is the primary concern , it is not surprising the <head>interests</head> of developers and of the well - being of cities are so often in conflict . The struggle between commercial pressure and good architecture is an unequal one ,  on which many developers are not prepared to expend much energy .  They value their architects more for their business demeanours than for their designs ,  and choose them from a limited number of established companies ,  more valued for reliability than originality .

Dr Smith explained that MB Group ,  formerly Metal Box ,  had identified Caradon 18 months ago as a suitable means of expanding into building products but the company had had to reorganise itself and create a new management team to make the current deal possible .  Earlier this year MB Group merged its world - wide packaging <head>interests</head> with the French Carnaud to form CMB in which it has a 25.5 per cent stake . This meant it could concentrate on two core businesses  security printing and heating and bathroom products .  Caradon was bought from publishers Reed International for 61m in 1985 and came to the stock market in June 1987 with an initial market value of 134m .

It is shrewd of Mr Kinnock to attempt to enlist this mood and to link Labour with such concepts as patriotism ,  efficiency and plain common sense ,  virtues which have more often been associated with the Conservative Party. Similarly ,  it is shrewd of him to play for the internationalist vote after a prolonged period of sullen Little Englandism during which Labour threatened to withdraw from the Common Market and called into question this country 's  role within Nato .

The decision is part of a much wider shift in government thinking ,  in which Mr Patten has clearly been given Cabinet permission to distance his own policy from that of predecessors ,  such as Michael Heseltine ,  and ,  to a lesser extent ,  Mr Ridley ,  now Trade and Industry Secretary ,  who believed that economic success depended on getting the planner off the backs of business and citizen alike .

This is pretty low for a speculative investment and assumes the company is capitalised at 12.5 times earnings in the year to 31 March 2017 .  A combination of a six month construction over - run and attendance of only 10 million cuts the return to 12 per cent .  Eurodisney and its advisers , SG Warburg , can feel confident that the issue will go well because of the <head>interest</head> already shown in France , where half the 607m of shares will be issued . They have fired this interest by spending 44m on the issue ,  aiming it primarily at the retail investor when one might expect an issue of this sort to be more suitable for institutions .  As with a privatisation ,  small investors may be tempted by short term profits and ,  like Eurotunnel ,  the issue is a hostage to many variables .

We would be happy to do more ventures involving cross - shareholdings ,  especially in Europe .  The half year result was a 34 per cent rise over last time ,  and at the higher end of City estimates .  The <head>interest</head> charge , at 35m against 24m , was lower than many had expected . Mr Tennant explained that this was partly because payments for the LVMH shares had been delayed ,  but added :  We are not really exposed to UK interest rates .  Most of our debt is in the form of US dollars or French francs ,  where rates are a good deal lower .

Stockholders account for 60 per cent of the 20 million tonnes of steel sold in the UK each year .  British Steel already held 15 per cent of the stockholder market through its own service centres operation .  Walker , which bought out GKN 's steel stockholding <head>interests</head> two years ago , has a market share of 20 per cent . Sir Robert said British Steel would now rest content at the combined figure of 35 per cent .  The acquisition of Walker will put British Steel on a par with its rivals in Germany and France which control up to 70 per cent of the stockholding outlets through which their steel is sold to industrial customers .

Many building societies have pared this down yet further by offering loss - leader discounts on standard loan rates to attract new business .  Roughly half the leading building societies '  borrowers repay on budget schemes .  They will pay nothing more now , but will have the delayed <head>interest</head> on at least two mortgage rate rises to account for when the new yearly rates are fixed early in 1990 . The anticipated increase in rates to 14.75 per cent would mean a hike of 95p per thousand pounds borrowed without the benefit of income tax relief .  The monthly bill for a repayment loan of 100,000 would cost 1,117.73 ,  an increase of more than 8 per cent after tax relief .

Between a focus on Britain and a broad appreciation of the world of which it is but a part ?  There is a particular problem with contemporary history .  Schools have shown increasing <head>interest</head> in it , helped by such excellent organisations as the Institute for Contemporary British History , but there is limited room in the curriculum for the twentieth century , let alone for the period from when the text books end and memory begins . Attitudes to the recent past are largely shaped by experience and the nature and extent of these experiences vary .  This is very much a generational problem .

Once you accept outside Palestinians ,  you validate the concept of their right of return to their former homes in what is now Israel ,  a Likud source said .  Likud sources are confident the disagreements over how to respond to the Mubarak proposals will not break up the government .  It 's in no one 's <head>interests</head> to have a government crisis . The US does n't want one for three reasons .  First ,  it will postpone any movement towards a peace process .

The big traders were so supine ,  they just caved in after one letter .  He said that only a couple of other booksellers in the country had been brave enough to ignore the letters .  The Government initiated proceedings against Mr Marsh in September last year , but after a lengthy delay while he unsuccessfully tried to obtain legal aid , the case was dropped because it was judged to be no longer in the public <head>interest</head> . The case against two other booksellers was also being dropped .  Mr Marsh was so incensed by the attempted prosecution that he took out a summons to obtain his costs ,  and yesterday at a brief hearing in the High Court the Attorney General agreed to pay his costs and not to take any further action on the matter .
