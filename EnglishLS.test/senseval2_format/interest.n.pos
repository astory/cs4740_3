How much can I covenant ?  Covenant payments are made out of your income and are not capital payments .  You could covenant all your taxable income if you wished remember though that a part of your total income will not be subject to tax , because of the various tax allowances you enjoy ( personal allowances , mortgage <head>interest</head> relief , etc. ) If you are planning to give a particularly large sum ,  it is always more advantageous to give out of income by covenant than to give a capital sum .  You can spread the payments over as long a period as you like .

The library user who looks for books of art criticism is not necessarily going to have an easy task .  Let us picture a girl entering through the impressive doors of the New York Public Library .  Her <head>interest</head> has been aroused by some new paintings which she has seen in a SoHo gallery , which a friend has compared unfavourably with the work of Lee Krasner . This comparison has fazed  her ,  as she only knows about Lee Krasner as the widow of Jackson Pollock ;  so the library visit is intended to check out reproductions of Lee Krasner 's  work ,  to see if she has to concede that her friend may be right .  The resources available to her are excellent ;  the library has an extensive stock of books ,  long runs of periodicals ,  press cuttings ,  and up - to - date facilities to find relevant material .

For the latter catalogue Barr chose the Surrealist writer Georges Hugnet to write a historical essay ,  but it was Barr 's  intelligent advocacy and choice of works that made the show such a significant affair .  In place of the aggressive approach of the early years of Surrealism itself ,  Barr 's  commentary is in moderated phrases pointing to similarities between Surrealism and works firmly within the tradition of Western art :  The explanation of the kind of art shown in this exhibition may be sought in the deep - seated and persistent <head>interest</head> which human beings have in the fantastic , the irrational , the spontaneous , the marvellous , the enigmatic , and the dreamlike . These qualities have always been present in the metaphors and similes of poetry but they have been less frequent in painting ,  which in the past was largely concerned with reproducing external reality ,  with decoration ,  or ,  as in the more advanced movements of recent years ,  with the composition of  color  and line into formal design .  On Dada he wrote :  With robust iconoclastic  humor  the Dadaists mocked what they considered the sorry shams of European culture .

Art history without names was a phrase used by Heinrich Wlflinn ,  in his introduction to The Principles of Art History  first published in 1915 .  Wlflinn was Burckhardt 's  successor as professor at Basel ,  but his later successful career took him to Berlin ,  Munich and Zrich ,  a major art historian whose interests were primarily in the Renaissance and the Baroque .  Wlflinn was naturally not ignorant of artists , but the famous phrase indicated an <head>interest</head> in the sequence of art seen as forms which develop as if of their own volition . Wlflinn 's  writings are strong on observation ;  this can be understood from his choice of terms to describe tendencies in form ;  linear as against painterly ,  plane surface as against recessional depth ,  closed against open form ,  composite clarity against fused clarity ,  or absolute clarity against relative clarity .  Such polarities were evidently valuable aids to several generations of Wlflinn 's  pupils who could benefit from his personal teaching as well as the rather more rigid theory in his books .

In a number of places Pilinski completely misunderstood the indications of the original .  THE SURVEY WITH A THEME Themes in art have a fascination , since they add a subject <head>interest</head> to a viewer 's enjoyment of artistic qualities . The portrait is an endlessly interesting example ,  a theme redolent with social connotations and artistic references .  In Dostoevsky 's  opinion ,  The portrait painter seeks the moment when the model looks most like himself ;  in the capacity to find and hold this moment lies also the talent of the portraitist .

This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's  writing ,  since it tempts the rash into speculation ,  while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons .  A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .  Again , much <head>interest</head> attaches to interpretation , as an impassive hierarchical image of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure . The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have difficulty in deciding how far the picture needs  to be considered as devotional imagery ,  and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits .

Born in Hamburg ,  he was transferred to the Manor House at Amnersfield ,  the son of a remote German - American mother and of a sour ,  withdrawn ,  irritable Anglo - Scottish father ,  who would retreat behind the Times  and spend the evening in lonely state ,  smoking his pipe in his kilt .

Reading plays is an essential part of your career preparation  the more plays you read the more you will understand of the  theatre 's  development .  Academic study of drama as such is not necessarily useful for the actor ,  but an awareness of playwrights and their various styles is  of practical value .  A play is primary a piece of action and although a script contains some scenic and character description , the essential <head>interest</head> lies in the dialogue and the action arising from it . A play really demands to be read aloud  - it needs the sound of the human voice to bring it alive .  It takes imagination and a lot of practice to read a play to yourself in the same time as it would take to see it on the stage .

You always have your agent to refer to should anyone make you an offer .

It 's  difficult to evaluate how successful such co - ops are but many do seem to gain work on a fairly reasonable basis for their members ,  and they are certainly worth considering .

Also ,  there can be no doubt that the South would intervene in the North on behalf of the catholic  nationalist minority if Britain withdrew and civil war broke out .  Equally ,  Southern catholic nationalists prefer a unified Irish state ,  though a majority of 54 per cent would accept a federal one based on the present two state units .  One can therefore conclude that there is a sense of unity throughout the catholic nationalist population as a whole , though one in which certain groups , namely farming <head>interests</head> and the church , at both clerical and popular levels , have strategically dominated , at least until recently . By 1914 ,  the protestant  loyalist group was well established and ready for war against catholic nationalists should it have proven necessary .  Issues of class conflict within the group were to remain largely subordinate ,  as the matter of the nature and defence of loyalism itself was to dominate the scene right down to the present day .

Castle catholics ,  those who found a place in the Stormont administration and developed a stake in the union ,  have also voted alliance ,  but are probably now ,  in 1989 ,  switching their allegiance to the newly found conservative associations ,  which are seeking to bring British party loyalties to Ulster .  The Northern Ireland statelet was founded on an alliance between the protestant loyalists of Ulster and British imperial and capital interests ,  particularly as represented by the conservative party .  But that is what the arrangement was : an alliance rather than a consolidated <head>interest</head> or a genuinely shared culture . Protestant loyalists dominated the statelet from its formation .  The British government only obtained certain concessions from the Stormont government in implementing measures of the welfare state variety after 1944 .

In 1927 ,  1929 ,  1956 ,  and 1960 ,  there were plenary synods and councils .  Since then ,  the hierarchy has met more or less three times per year ,  but usually in secret sessions .  In the North , the bishops pursued the Irish catholic community 's <head>interests</head> in what could only be called a spirit of pillarization . This is the arrangement in Holland whereby various institutions such as media ,  schools ,  cultural organizations ,  welfare services ,  and hospitals are duplicated ,  and run by the separate catholic and protestant communities .

There did exist the small Northern Ireland Labour Party which disappeared after the fall of Stormont ;  but it had been based on industrial workers ,  particularly in the shipyards ,  and remained much smaller in size than its Southern counterpart .  As Gibbon has noted ,  the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles  ( 1975 :  3 )  .  The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic nationalist and protestant loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material <head>interests</head> of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions . By providing core beliefs ,  and by reinforcing their separateness for both alliances ,  religious beliefs and institutions equally suppress class divisions ,  become embroiled in cementing alliances ,  and help retain the overall divisional structure of Ireland as a whole .

It proved to be a period of strained relations with the English liberals ,  who were allies of the Irish party ,  but who were also in favour of bringing schooling more and more under state rather than church control  ( Miller 1973 :  817 ,  12038 ,  26892 )  .  By this time ,  the schools frequented by Roman catholics in Ireland were also largely under the direct control of the church 's  clerics .  But secularizing moves by the English liberals over the Education Bills of 1902 , 1906 , and a private member 's Bill of 1911 led the Irish hierarchy to question some of the political intentions of the Irish politicians , who it was feared might sell out the church 's <head>interest</head> in schools . According to the Liberal - Irish alliance ,  the Irish party was supposed to abstain from the 1901 Conservative bill ,  aimed at bringing denominational schools in England and Wales into the national education system while at the same time absenting them from local government control :  that is ,  giving finance while maintaining the system of denominational clerical control .  With the Irish party abstaining ,  both English and Irish Roman catholic bishops began to pressurize the leader of the Irish party ,  Redmond ,  and his associates to support the Conservative bill .

In addition ,  Roman catholic schools in Ireland ,  in continuity with the belief and practice of Roman catholics in a number of other countries ,  have a different concept and practice of teaching religion in the schools from that of the majority of protestant traditions .  This ranges from the presence of religious symbols in the classrooms and corridors of the schools to religious services such as mass or the saying of the rosary ,  and finally to the specific form of religious education which is praxis oriented .  Learning , singing , and praying are rolled up into one : catechesis , as opposed to dialogue or concerned <head>interest</head> for religious matters .

At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .  In recent years serious damage to the historic interiors of pubs has resulted from the creation of the open - plan which now seem to be pubs '  standard internal layout .  Often the creation of the open plan interior requires the removal of walls , chimney breasts , stairs and other internal features of <head>interest</head> , which is highly destructive of the building 's historic character . The owner of The Hollybush at Elstree proposed to infill an original coach arch in the pub 's  facade and to demolish the timber framed side walls of the passageway behind in order to form a larger and open interior ,  even though it was this feature that distinguished the building as an historic inn .  In the most extreme cases the existing building is so different from the historic pub concept that a virtual rebuild is proposed .

We contest that there are no laws written in stone ,  and that there is room for hybrids .  As regards restoration ,  just as we would not dream of stripping out the original interior of the Blackfriar ,  by the same token we would not seek to preserve a Thirties estate pub which had long since ceased to address the needs of the community it was built to serve .  It is in our <head>interests</head> as designers in this field to ensure that the pub tradition that we all hold so dear remains a living tradition . As was so chillingly illustrated by the postwar period of mass destruction and misconceived redevelopment ,  it is possible to throw the baby out with the bathwater .  However ,  to entrap our pub tradition within a rigid set of rules and guidelines is at best to condemn it to becoming an anachronism ,  if not to extinguish it altogether .

Immediately the police officer/anthropologist sets out to undertake research or record fieldnotes he is forced to confront a moral dilemma .

It had a marked effect on those who read his poetry ,  and a few  years  later Leonard was to find himself tutored by one of Pound 's  most sympathetic admirers and directed to the understanding of the American 's  verse ,  somewhat to Leonard 's  concern ,  as we shall see .  We should not ,  however ,  think that these years were those of some frustrated novice - monk  ( not that Judaism has such in any case !  )  of solitary and sober reading from dawn till nightfall .  Leonard was full - blooded , physically and temperamentally , and these teenage years saw him active in a wide range of sporting <head>interests</head> : cycling ( one of his favourite pastimes then ) , skiing , swimming , canoeing , sailing and ice - hockey ( in which he made the school team ) , boxing and wrestling , though he was very little involved in the last two . He did not attend any professional fights nor ,  unlike his later friend Irving Layton ,  did he get much involved in fisticuffs .  There was ,  of course ,  the all - important interest in the opposite sex .

( This was done by those Jews who wished to make a Zionistic point ,  but it was not so shared by Leonard or his family .  )  Other aspects of his answers are equally interesting :  he admits to not having won any prizes or scholarships ,  having apparently settled for doing what was required  that ,  and no more !  He mentions his presidency of the Student Council , and his chairmanship of Student Productions ; as well as an <head>interest</head> in debating current events .

Stirring at these roots in a different way was his friend of eight or nine years ,  Morton Rosengarten .  One year older than Leonard ,  he went through the varying experiences of adolescence with him ,  sharing not least Leonard 's  musical interest  ( Morton played both the banjo and the trombone )  ,  as well as a variety of pastimes and a healthy interest in the fairer sex .  Unlike Leonard , he had very little <head>interest</head> in the synagogue and broke from its traditions much more decisively , finding Leonard 's continuance somewhat irritating . ( Krantz is modelled on Rosengarten in The Favourite Game  ,  though highly fictionalised .  )  He was always impressed with Leonard 's  room ,  which he found to resemble more a study than a youth 's  bedroom  already the style was evident .

Nevertheless ,  he felt bound to accept the challenge of post - graduate work at Columbia University in New York ,  albeit with deepening reservations .  Moreover ,  Dudek had taken his doctorate at Columbia ,  and Federico Garia Lorca had studied there a few years before Leonard was born .  Almost immediately on arrival , surrounded by the cosmopolitan excitement of New York , its immense anonymity , the total lack of personal <head>interest</head> shown towards him after having been the centre of warmth and appreciation in Montreal , he knew that it was not for him. Columbia University 's  Law School had no charms ,  no personal comfort  ( like the surrounding high - rise buildings )  ;  there must be another way .  Paul Robeson  himself a belatedly famed son of the Law School  might embody law and song ,  and F.R.

In this ,  all assumptions about external reality are suspended  ( bracketed )  and the theorist focuses entirely upon his field of immediate experience .  It is not a million miles away from Fodor 's methodological solipsism though phenomenologists have little <head>interest</head> in the causal interplay between the mental states thus identified .

It is not easy to achieve this effect if they do not take into account the dimension and spacing of the steps as well as their particular quality ,  which must be in tune with the music if it is to make sense .

Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement or alignment can add <head>interest</head> and draw attention to a dancer 's statement . for example :  the swift change from the grand dvelopp   la seconde  which Odile makes facing the audience and her sudden turn to arabesque  when she looks straight into the kneeling Siegfried 's  eyes in the Act II pas de deux of Swan Lake  ;  it is Odile 's  triumph for she knows she has won Siegfried 's  heart .  Even more exciting changes of aulement  can be found in Ashton 's  Birthday  Offering  where each soloist dances an old step at a new angle ,  without breaking the rules or older conventions of nineteenth - century ballet .

Without this attitude ,  and given the inventiveness of many beer advertisements ,  we can forget about our greatest asset ,  the local and traditional character of British brewing .

MacCabe and Heath had studied in Paris ,  and Signs of the Times  has its niche in postwar cultural history ,  marking the first major re - entry of French intellectual influences since Eliot 's  adherence to Remy de Gourmont and the French neoclassicists ,  half a century earlier .  For the sake of convenience I shall apply the term la nouvelle critique  to the complex  of ideas emerging from the Paris of the 1960s ,  including many diverse strands :  the classical structuralism of the early Barthes ,  the poststructuralism of his later work ,  the deconstructionism of Derrida ,  and whatever name one gives to the work of Foucault and Lacan ,  in taxonomic historiography and dissident psychoanalysis respectively .  Frank Kermode was the first senior academic in English studies to take a sympathetic <head>interest</head> in la nouvelle critique , particularly its analysis of narrative . For some years before his move to Cambridge he chaired a seminar at University College London ,  which discussed the literary implications of structuralism ,  semiotics ,  and emergent poststructuralism .  He has remarked ,  No other phase of my academic life has given me so much pleasure and instruction .

In its new freedom ,  it can be seen to cause a new reality to come into being   ( Hawkes 's  italics )  .  Or consider the density of trope and implication in the following :  New New Criticism would thus claim to respond to literature 's  essential nature in which signifiers are prised utterly free of signifieds ,  aiming ,  in its no - holds - barred  encounter with the text ,  for a coherence  and validity  of response ,  not objectivity and truth  ( Hawkes 's  italics )  .  Raymond Tallis has described this passage as being of great <head>interest</head> to the pathologist of modern literary theory . In certain respects ,  what Hawkes calls the New New Criticism had what looked like connections with the older version .  Both were directed towards the formalist reading of literary texts ,  and some anglophone academics tried to minimize the strangeness of French imports by saying that la nouvelle critique  was only offering a new version of what had long been familiar in the Anglo - American academy .

The enthusiasm has ,  of course ,  been exploited ,  in the opportunistic launching of courses in women 's  studies ,  and by the publishing industry which has filled the shelves of bookshops  general as well as academic  with books with women in their titles .  One of the most interesting and welcome results of literary feminism has been the reprinting of forgotten texts ,  usually by women but occasionally by men .  In an earlier Chapter I argued that the canon is bursting , because of the advent of other anglophone literatures , and the increasing <head>interest</head> in contemporary writing . Undoubtedly ,  the new availability of earlier texts of feminist interest is helping the explosion .  At the same time ,  at the level of practical pedagogy ,  there is a counter - tendency in the study of the national canon to concentrate more and more on a small and diminishing number of texts .

It is noticeable that though Derrida is a philosopher ,  albeit one interested in literature ,  and has always worked in an academic - philosophical context ,  even if on the margins of the subject ,  his major impact in North America has been in literature departments .  Though some of his followers have philosophical training and interests ,  and are acquainted with the matrices of Derrida 's  thought in Hegel ,  Husserl ,  and Heidegger ,  his transmission in literary and cultural contexts has meant that his ideas have become simplified ,  his paradoxes and contradictions tamed and diminished .  One writer , whose <head>interest</head> in poststructuralism is primarily philosophical , has commented : the reception of Derrida 's  work ,  perhaps more than that of any other recent French thinker ,  has been marked by an astonishingly casual and unquestioning acceptance of certain extremely condensed  not to say sloganistic  characterisations of the history of Western thought ,  as if this history could be dismissed through its reduction to a set of perfunctory dualisms .  People in literature departments are not used to handling ideas ,  it not being their mtier  ,  and traditionally they were not  required to ,  beyond such elementary tokens as the Elizabethian World Picture or the Death of God .

Thus ,  The Tempest  is about colonialism ;  not only The taming of the Shrew  but King Lear  and Measure for Measure  are a focus for feminist readings ;  while Henry V  encodes a contemporary Elizabethan colonialist endeavour ,  the fantasy of a successful Irish campaign .  These readings are intermittently illuminating ,  if reductive ,  and basically they are doing what criticism has always done ,  which is to interpret the works of the past in the terms and concepts of the critic 's  own age .  It is precisely this capacity for renewed interpretation that makes literature of more than simply historical <head>interest</head> . Latterday Marxist interpreters of Shakespeare are doing much the same as the conservative proponents of the Elizabethan World Picture did thirty or forty years ago ,  though with a different  conceptual model .  The contemporary New Historicists ,  however ,  are unlike interpreters of the past ,  in that they are concerned with exclusively political readings ,  without any possibility of aesthetic or affective responses .

If this meant there were potential conflicts between research and pedagogy ,  that was a price that had to be paid .  With the passing of time ,  the subject expanded further ,  institutional pressures became greater ,  and a gap widened between the professionals who taught literature and the poets ,  novelists ,  and dramatists ,  somewhere out in society ,  who wrote it ,  notwithstanding the increasing presence of contemporary literature as a university subject .  In this last respect , American experience is significantly different ; writers - in - residence are common on campuses as teachers of creative writing , though literary theorists show little <head>interest</head> in what is being written . Donald Davie has suggested that one reason for the explosion of theory is that it provides a stamping ground for the innumerable people in departments of English  ( also of French ,  of German ,  of Classics )  who have energy and intelligence but no literary sensibility .  Davie 's  provocative point is well taken .

This current feeling for the past might provide a way in adult classes of shifting the emphasis from popular modern writing to earlier literature .  Chaucer looked at in isolation can seem daunting ,  but Chaucer read in a cultural and historical context ,  with visual and other aids ,  could come alive as a great poet ,  speaking across six centuries ,  in a Gadamerian fusion of horizons .  I am not , though , recommending the ideological antiquarianism of the New Historicism , which has little <head>interest</head> in poetry as such . This is a speculative proposal ,  merely ,  and it may fall foul of the fact  that in our image - ridden culture reading is difficult ,  and literary texts still demand to be read  ,  rigorously and carefully .  In cultural history reading about something may be good enough ;  in studying literature it is not.

BARRISTERS could retain much of their monopoly over advocacy in the higher courts under a subtle agenda for discussion spelled out by Lord Donaldson ,  the Master of the Rolls ,  as he opened the Bar 's  annual conference in London at the weekend .  Signalling the beginning of a lower - key campaign against the plans of the Lord Chancellor ,  Lord Mackay of Clashfern ,  to give increased rights of audience in the High and Crown court to solicitors ,  Lord Donaldson called on the Bar to put aside the trauma ,  the acrimony and the recriminations which followed Lord Mackay 's  Green Papers and to abandon the hustings .  Lord Donaldson said objectives due to be included in this autumn 's Bill were total freedom of choice for the client , unless the <head>interests</head> of justice otherwise require . When those concerned turn their attention to this problem ,  they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public interest in the result and that in which the public interest is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available .  In the first category we have criminal cases ,  judicial review and cases which involve matrimonial status and the welfare of children or those under a disability .

In many of them ,  particularly criminal cases ,  the interests of the client may be quite different from those of the public .  In these cases the interests of justice may demand special requirements such as ,  for example ,  that the preparation and presentation of the case be in separate and independent hands .  In the second category , general civil cases , parties should be able to choose their own lawyers because the <head>interests</head> of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's right of choice . Lord Donaldson implied ,  however ,  that solicitors who exercised their new rights of audience in these cases ought to be expected to concentrate on advocacy .  While emphasising that he had not reached any firm conclusions ,  Lord Donaldson 's  voice will be a powerful one in behind - the - scenes manoeuvres as rules governing the exercise of the new advocacy rights are hammered out away from the parliamentary battlefield .

The most substantial ,  Honour Hong Kong ,  is sponsored by many of the colony 's  biggest companies .

Hong Kong companies are not well - known moralists : their main <head>interest</head> lies in staunching their own losses of trained workers , and preserving the machinery of government . To answer that immediate need ,  the British government has been agonising over how to offer a single tranche of passports ,  perhaps 100,000 ,  to Hong Kong ,  in such a way as to target recipients whom it believes play vital roles in the public and private sector .

Grand Metropolitan ,  which is believed to be keen to sell its extensive brewing interests ,  came to life in late trading ,  jumping 21p to 599p as the story flowed that Sir James Goldsmith and friends were stake - building .  Grand Met was also the busiest option stock ,  claiming nearly 2,800 contracts .  It was suggested Goldsmith <head>interests</head> already had two per cent and were planning to build a significant shareholding to encourage the Grand Met board to consider a breakup . The stock market theory is that the Goldsmith contingent needs a new challenge now its bid for BAT Industries has effectively evaporated .  The Goldsmith plan to break up BAT has been overtaken by BAT 's  decision to do the job itself .

Those who went have betrayed their country .  Bonn 's  principle that East Germans have an automatic right to West German citizenship and protection is revanchism ,  its refusal to turn refugees away from its embassies is a provocation .  The decision to expel the first batch of embassy refugees to the West was a humanitarian act done in the <head>interests</head> of the many children involved and to avoid epidemics . The expellees have in any case isolated themselves from East German society ,  they are mindless strays ,  many of them are antisocial and the country is better off without them .  A recent Protestant Church Synod ,  where speakers aired grievances and called for change ,  was a conspiracy to prepare the way for reunification .

Aware of the strength of public opinion ,  Mrs Aquino ordered flags on government buildings to be flown at half mast in a conciliatory gesture .  Yesterday she emphasised again that her decision was based on sensitive information that showed Marcos 's  return could be destabilising .  I am doing this in the <head>interest</head> of the great majority of our people , she said . A group of Marcos loyalists yesterday filed a petition to the Supreme Court seeking to reverse an earlier ruling that upheld Mrs Aquino 's  decision to bar Marcos 's  return .  Mrs Aquino has said she will bow to its decision but is confident it will again rule in her favour .

However ,  it is King 's  work in Wales that is his great legacy .  He was a frequent attender of the Chateau Gaillard European Castle Studies conferences ,  and contributed several papers to the published proceedings .  He always had a deep <head>interest</head> in siege engines and the construction of scale working models of these machines ; one of the memorable events of the Chateau Gaillard conference at Durham University was witnessing David 's experiments with his machines on the campus lawns , using marbles for ammunition . In 1962 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and later ,  from 1976 to 1977 ,  he served as President of the Cambrian Archaelogical Association .  In 1987 the University of Wales Press published a collection of essays written by his admirers in his honour .

This would lead to a decline in the volume of less essential traffic in urban and rural areas and bring an overall reduction in all its adverse effects ,  including its contribution ,  through carbon dioxide ,  to global warming  certain to be very high on the political agenda in the next few years .  Such a tax could be introduced almost overnight .  It could be raised if found to be effective in achieving public <head>interest</head> objectives . Moreover ,  it would not require the high administrative and technical costs of road pricing .  History shows that the long - term effect of altering the price of motorised travel does not necessarily affect the amount of money people and organisations spend on transport .

Caroline Willbourne ,  a London barrister specialising in family law ,  said decriminalisation of sexual offences within the family where the offender admitted the abuse was in the interests of child victims .  Court proceedings should be of a civil rather than criminal nature ,  she said .  You often find the civil court has dealt with the abuse and the perpetrator in the context of what is in the best <head>interests</head> of the child . But she added that prosecution and imprisonment by a criminal court did not serve the interests of the family as a whole ,  or of the child who remained part of it ,  or how victims would deal with contact with the abuser after release .  Ms Willbourne also called for the civil courts to be given new powers to exclude an abuser from the home instead of the child .

Shah said that he was later offered Edwards 's  51 per cent holding ,  which Knighton has agreed to buy for around 10m ,  but only on payment of a 6m premium .  Shah made a counter offer ,  which expired last night ,  with a 1m premium .  The former Today owner said he had seen documentation from Scottish financial institutions which put Knighton 's personal net worth at around 3m , and added : I think he should now step aside and let somebody in who has the <head>interests</head> of the club at heart . A confidant of Owen Oyston ,  the Lancashire businessman who owns the Miss World beauty competition business ,  said that Knighton and Oyston met at Manchester City 's  Maine Road ground last Saturday .  A proposition was put to Owen ,  and he is considering it ,  the source said .

The most obvious manifestation of this came when he remained almost immobile in the centre of the ring while Biggs picked him off with jabs from long range .  But Biggs also ran out of steam as the contest progressed towards the later rounds although he managed to conceal this inadequacy from the British champion .  A delighted Mason could not be sure which punch ended Biggs 's <head>interest</head> in the proceedings and no one could be sure about the outcome as the bell approached . Before a demoralising defeat when challenging Mike Tyson for the world heavyweight championship two years ago Biggs would have probably been too dangerous a proposition for Mason but something has gone from him since then and he was unable to fulfil bold pre - fight assertions .  Both men took heavy blows and by withstanding the best of the American 's  punches Mason at least emphasised that he has a strong enough chin .

The Ford Pay claim coincides with negotiations at Vauxhall where leaders of the 9,000 manual workers have turned down a two - year offer giving 9.1 per cent in the first year and inflation plus 3 in the second .

So long as there is a full right of appeal against a refusal of leave  a right which the present Government sought ,  at one stage ,  to abolish  this handicap is acceptable ,  even though it places public authorities in a more privileged position than the ordinary litigant .  A less acceptable handicap is the special rule that the application for judicial review must normally be made within only three months from the decision complained of .  It is in the public <head>interest</head> for challenges to the exercise of public powers to be made promptly , so that the administration and citizens alike know what the law is . But it is unjust that the individual 's  right of access to the courts should be restricted solely on the ground that there has been delay in making the application .  As the Law Commission recommended in 1976 ,  the test should be whether the granting of relief to an applicant who has delayed would cause substantial prejudice or hardship to any person or would be detrimental to good administration .

Last night ,  United announced that Edwards was taking leading counsels '  advice as to the validity of his agreement with Knighton .  Knighton has been in contact with several businessmen from the Manchester area in attempts to get wider backing for his 20m bid ,  which has hit financial snags .  One of them , Eddy Shah , the former national newspaper owner , said he was no longer interested in a deal with Knighton , but another , Owen Oyston , a local radio - station owner and property entrepreneur , applied to the Football League for permission to obtain a financial <head>interest</head> in United . That could mean another football club gets involved in the United wheeler - dealing .  Oyston is also chairman and owner of Blackpool Football Club ,  and is seeking the permission of the League to waive their rule that no one may hold more than 10 per cent of a club if he has a financial interest in another .
