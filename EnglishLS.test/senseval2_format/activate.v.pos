They were seen to succeed in living a sexually pure life as part of this .  There was some extension of the pietistic ideal .

But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed ,  with clergy being left behind in some areas ,  the clerics remain the true cognoscenti  in religious matters ,  and are expected to be so by the laity .

Gilbert refers to a dissertation by Richard Allen Soloway which shows contemporary fears of Christianity falling before the atheistical ,  licentious ,  and immoral foreigner  ( Sexual Deviance and Disaster ,  98 ,  99 ,  1001 ,  11011 )  .  The sodomite becomes a virulent image of this threat ,  embodying a foreign infection which in turn is linked to social disorder and economic collapse at home .  A violent , enduring mythology is <head>activated</head> to make sense of immediate socio - political crisis and fear . This analysis suggests that if ,  in periods of intensified conflict ,  crisis is displaced on to the deviant ,  the process only succeeds because of the paranoid instabilities at the heart of dominant cultural identities .  Further ,  such displacements of non - sexual fears on to the sexual deviant ,  be he or she actual ,  imagined ,  or constituted in and by the displacement ,  are made possible because other kinds of transgression  political ,  religious  are not only loosely associated with the sexual deviant ,  but condensed in the very definition of deviance .

After trying various neurotransmitters the group found that serotonin could potentiate the cell 's  response  ie  enhance the response to stimulation .  The difference between long and short term memory depends on whether certain NMDA  (  N  methyl - D - aspartate )  receptors were activated or not. A stronger ( long ) serotonin stimulus causes the release of amino acids which <head>activate</head> the NMDA receptors , leading to long term memory . A short stimulus gives only a transient NMDA elevation ,  but if the cells are treated with both serotonin and NMDA ,  then long term potentiation could be induced .  The team also found that long term potentiation led to the persistent elevation of cAMP in the cells ,  while short term potentiation was associated with only a transient elevation of cAMP .

The suggestion that pre - exposure to a stimulus establishes an exact representation of it ,  for instance ,  is not in itself enough to explain latent inhibition ;  indeed it seems capable of predicting quite the wrong result .  The ability of the CS to evoke the CR after conditioning trials have been given will depend ,  in part ,  upon that stimulus being identified with the one that was presented during conditioning .  To the extent that this identification is more likely to be made when the stimulus in question is already capable of <head>activating</head> a detailed representation , the likelihood of a vigorous CR may be increased . What we have already seen ,  however ,   ( p. 24 )  is that pre - exposure to the to - be - CS results in retarded  development of the CR .  Clearly ,  this aspect of our account of habituation is not enough in itself to explain the latent inhibition effect .

This is what has been claimed for an alternative associative account put forward by McLaren ,  Kaye ,  and Mackintosh  ( 1989 )  .  This theory develops the convergence  ( also noted by others ,  e.g. Sutton and Barto 1981 ;  Gluck and Bower 1988 )  between standard associative models and connectionist systems of parallel distributed processing  ( e.g. Rumelhart ,  Hinton ,  and McClelland 1986 )  and it is intended to apply to a range of phenomena in perceptual learning .  For our present purposes , however , the important feature of the model is that it develops the implications of the widely accepted notion that even the simplest stimulus will consist of a set ( probably a large number ) of elements and that only some of these will be sampled ( will <head>activate</head> their central representations ) on a given exposure ( cf. Estes 1950 ;  Neimark and Estes 1967 )  .  Latent inhibition is held to be a consequence of the formation of associations among these elements .

All the accounts of latent inhibition discussed so far have assumed that what is learned during pre - exposure interferes with the formation of the CS - US association .  Revusky  ( 1971 )  call his theory a concurrent  interference theory to emphasize just this point and to distinguish it from another commonly held interpretation of proactive interference .  According to this alternative view , the target association may be formed perfectly normally but since , on a subsequent test trial , both this and any previously learned association will become <head>activated</head> when the CS is presented , the subjects may fail to retrieve the correct one and the likelihood of the CR will be reduced . Indeed ,  the effects of retrieval failure may also be evident during the course of conditioning itself because any trial after the first can be viewed as being a test trial on which the subject is required to retrieve information acquired on earlier trials .  Clearly the retrieval - failure hypothesis will make many of the same predictions as other theories of latent inhibition .

One possibility that follows from Wagner 's   ( 1981 )  theory is that the magnitude of the CR might actually be enhanced .  In the context used for training ,  contextual cues will be able to establish an A2 )   ( secondary activation )  representation of the CS thereby limiting the ability of the stimulus itself to evoke Al  ( primary activation )  .  In a different context , however , the CS will be able to evoke Al and since the Al state is better than A2 at <head>activating</head> an associative link , the CS will be better able to elicit its CR when the context is changed . There may be other associative effects ,  however ,  and these allow the possibility that a change of context might reduce the likelihood of the CR .  In particular ,  associations will also be formed between the context and the US ,  allowing the former to come to elicit ,  at least to some degree ,  the CR evoked by the nominal CS .

Thus both A and B could become directly linked with a representation of stimulus X as shown in Fig 5.10 ( a )  .  Subsequent training with A followed by an unconditioned stimulus  ( US )  might allow the formation of an association between the associatively activated representation of X and the US .  Thus B would become capable of activating the US representation ( and of evoking a CR ) by way of its ability to <head>activate</head> the X representation . A and B might well have features in common from the outset  ( the c  elements in the figure )  and these will produce primary generalization  training on A will give associative strength to stimulus elements that are present also in B. The X representation functions in just the same way as the c  elements in producing generalization except for the fact that the ability of A and B to activate X is based on prior conditioning .  It should be acknowledged that not all theories of Pavlovian learning are entirely happy with the suggestion that an associatively activated representation can form an excitatory link with the  ( directly activated )  representation of some other event .

The critical aspect of differentiation theory in this context is its assertion that exposure to A and B will lead to an increase in the number of distinctive features that can be detected .  This must mean ,  in terms of the figure ,  an increase in the number of a  and b  elements activated by the stimuli ,  something that can be represented diagrammatically in more than one way .  Figure 5.11 ( b ) shows an increase in the areas a and b with a consequent reduction in the proportion ( although not the absolute number ) of c elements <head>activated</head> by a stimulus . figure 5.11 ( c )  presents a slightly different possibility in which the sizes of  the A and B circles have not been changed .  There is no net increase in the number of elements activated by a given stimulus but the circles have been moved apart ,  indicating not only an increase in the number of unique elements activated by a stimulus but a corresponding decrease in the number of common elements activated .

Transmitters and mediators The transmitter substances which we described in chapters 4 and 6 provided a valuable basis from which to start searching for new drugs .  Dale and his colleagues in the 1930s showed that acetylcholine , in addition to its other properties , was a local hormone relaying messages at autonomic ganglia , that is at critical points in the nerve pathways which control the heart and blood vessels , and at the sites where nerves <head>activate</head> voluntary muscles . The first drugs which could be relied on to reduce the dangerously high arterial pressure which precedes strokes and heart failure were substances which blocked the actions of acetylcholine at these ganglia ,  and so prevented the passage of nervous messages which put up the blood pressure .  A series of synthetic compounds ,  with a long pedigree going back to the work of Crum Brown and Fraser in the 1860s  ( see chapter 2 )  ,  were produced simultaneously by R. B. Barlow and H. R. Ing in the Pharmacology Laboratory at Oxford and by W. D. M.  ( later Sir William )  Paton and Eleanor Zaimis at the National Institute for Medical Research .

The Ijmuiden Ridge is highlighted as a possible structural influence in a manner analogous to the Dowsing Fault - Zone .  The Ijmuiden Ridge forms the southern edge of the inverted Broad Fourteens Basin and has the characteristics of a line of complex re - <head>activated</head> fault movement . Hercynian influences are largely obscured by the later structural effects ,  but as a result of the improved quality of seismic data ,  some important aspects of pre - Permian structure have been defined .  With the exception of the London - Brabant Massif ,  the structural form is considered to be largely independent of the Mesozoic structure described above .

Recent research in tumour promotion backs up this objection .  Tumour promoters are substances such as the phorbolesters that are n't carcinogenic by themselves but encourage the growth of malignant tumours in cells that have previously been exposed to a low dose of a true carcinogen  ( known as an initiator )  .  Researchers have now discovered that even by themselves , promoters can stimulate cells to produce <head>activated</head> forms of oxygen , known as free radicals . These can damage DNA .  Promoters presumably would fall within Albert 's  nongenotoxic or epigenetic category ,  a daunting prospect to those who favour erring on the side of safety .

Carcinogens awaken sleeping genes CANCER cells are almost by definition cells that have escaped from the controls that govern the behaviour of the individual cells in a multicellular organism .  And recent research has dramatically shown that one way for them to make the break is through the activation of cellular oncogenes genes that are more or less inactive in normal cells hut seem to be altered or <head>activated</head> in tumour cells ( New Scientist , vol 96 , p418 . Now two Americans ,  Vincent Wilson and Peter Jones at the University of Southern California ,  have evidence that one of the actions of cancer - causing chemicals may be to jam the mechanism that normally keeps these genes  as well as other cellular genes  under control .  The mechanism thee were looking at is a chemical modification of the DNA known as methylation .

Hayward and his collaborators are among those to have reported this discovery in ANAS  ( vol 79 ,  p 7842 )  ;  they ,  and a collaborative team led by Bob Gallow of the US National  Institutes  of Health and Carlo Croce of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia ,  have shown that the myc  gene is strategically placed at the breakpoint where the translocated fragment of chromosome 8 links up with chromosome 14 in lymphoma cells .  At the same time ,  Phil Ledler ,  Stuart Aaronson and G. Lenoir have gone further and shown that in Burkitt 's  lymphoma cells the myc  gene becomes linked with DNA - encoding parts of the antibody molecule .  But while these reports neatly confirm Kein 's and Hayward 's ideas about the activation of proto - oncogenes in leukaemias and lymphomas , they have also helped to unleash a surprisingly violent controversy about how the proto - oncogene is <head>activated</head> . Harvard 's  experiments on bird tumours ,  for example ,  showed that viral insertion increased the expression of the myc  gene  and Croce and his collaborators reported that they found increased expression of myc  in Burkin 's  lymphomas  ( Science  ,  vol 21 8 ,  p 983 )  .  But others have failed to find such quantitative increases ,  and suspect instead that in the course of translocation ,  the alene is altered in a way that causes a qualitative change in its product .

SATURATED hydrocarbons  ( alkanes )  such as methane and ethane contain the strongest known carbon - hydrogen bonds ;  bonds that are notoriously difficult to break in a controlled way .  Now chemists have discovered several compounds of transition metals such as tungsten and iridium that can split an alkane carbon - hydrogen bond to form a carbon - metal bond instead .  Once attached to a metal , an alkane is <head>activated</head> : it is easier to convert into other useful organic chemicals . The abundance of alkanes makes them particularly attractive starting materials for industrial processes .  The enormous stocks of methane under the North sea are mainly used for fuel  natural gas .

Bergman used his iridium compound in a sequence of reactions to demonstrate how to convert an alkane into an iodine derivative called an alkyl iodide .  Organic chemists can change alkyl iodides into almost any other products they want .  Although these transition metal compounds will <head>activate</head> carbon - hydrogen bonds , they do not behave catalytically , and so are of limited practical value . A catalyst facilitates a chemical process without being used up or changed itself .  Bergman 's  iridium compound ,  for example ,  is itself chemically altered during the alkyl iodode reaction .

Ch'i  is a universal fluid out of which bodies condense and into which they dissolve .

The concrete meaning of the word in ordinary language is in fact breath ,  and the alternations of breathing out and in are the paradigms for the ch'i  in its active phase moving ,  expanding ,   rarefying  as the Yang ,  and in its passive phase reverting to stillness ,  contracting ,  solidifying ,  as the Yin .

This has been an important influence in promoting a communicative approach to the teaching of languages .  It should be noted ,  however ,  that the rationale for such an approach relates primarily to the ends and not the means of learning ,  and is directed at furthering the cause of cultural co - operation in Europe .  The original concern for out - of - school education is evident in the way objectives are defined in terms of utility . : threshold level specifications are drawn up with an eye to meeting the needs of learners as eventual participants in contexts of communicative interaction , rather than with a concern to <head>activate</head> the actual learning process itself . Their relevance outside the situation for which they were designed ,  where eventual aims  cannot be so readily related to learning objectives ,  should not therefore be taken on trust  ( see Widdowson 1983 )  .  But it has been commonly supposed that specifications along threshold level lines must be universally relevant ,  without reference to the definition of objectives for learning on which the original threshold level specifications are based.

It will be clear that on any particular occasion of meaning negotiation the more familiar the schematic content or mode of communication ,  the less reliance needs to be placed on systemic knowledge ,  and vice versa .  If ,  for example ,  I am engaged in reading a text on a subject in which I am well versed  ( where the ideational or content schema is familiar )  ,  which has been written in a manner conventionally associated with writing on this subject  ( where the interpersonal or formal schema is familiar )  ,  then I shall only need to pay attention to the linguistic signs to the extent that they key in this schematic knowledge and indicate how it is to be extended .  Many of the specific meanings which can be deciphered out of the symbol are not <head>activated</head> because they are not indexically required . This ,  of course ,  relates to the point made by Johnson - Laird earlier :  that an effective  ( i.e. indexical )  use of language does not depend on knowing precise  ( i.e. symbolically complete )  meanings .  On the other hand ,  if I encounter a text which deals with an unfamiliar content area and does so in accordance .  with communicative or rhetorical conventions which are new to me ,  then I obviously have to look much more closely at the language itself as a source of information as to what might be meant .

The question that  then needed to be answered was whether the dd  fusion was being induced by collisions within the hot plasma  thermonuclear fusion  or from some other non - thermonuclear processes such as collisions between deuterons that had been accelerated to high energies during the initial pulse of current and other deuterons of comparatively low energies .

According to Marslen - Wilson and Welsh ,  a set of potential word candidates  ( the cohort )  is activated during the earliest phases of the word recognition process solely on the basis of bottom - up sensory information .  That is ,  all words sharing the same initial sound characteristics become activated in the system .  As the system detects mismatches between initial bottom - up sensory information and the top - down information about the expected sound representation of words generated by context , inappropriate candidates within the initial cohort are de - <head>activated</head> . A word is said to be recognised at the point when a particular word can be uniquely distinguished from all other words in the cohort .

If the adventurers are successful in picking the lock , this trap wo n't be <head>activated</head> , but they will have to be very careful taking out the money without breaking the glass sphere ( no test needed , but you should roll dice as if you were making some secret test just to scare the players ) .

Indeed ,  for most of human history we have tended to do the reverse ,  to use the analogy of the human mind to explain what happens in the physical world ,  an approach known as animism .  By the seventeenth century ,  however ,  engineers had become sufficiently skilled at making complex mechanical devices ,  powered by clockwork or water ,  to be able to make toys that moved in a fairly convincing approximation to the way that people and animals move .  Some were constructed so that they would only move when a passing person <head>activated</head> a treadle of some sort so that the toy would suddenly spring into life . The French mathematician Descartes remarked on the similarity between this sort of toy and the behaviour of animals ,  arguing that the latter were nothing more than automatons whose reactions were constantly triggered by events in the environment  ( Jeannerod 1985 )  .  Not knowing about electricity ,  but knowing about hydraulic systems ,  Descartes suggested that the control of these reactions in animals was mediated by movements of fluids ,  initiated in the sensory nerves by stimuli ,  being carried to the ventricular system of the brain where contact was made with the motor nerves .

Indeed ,  their emotional behaviour was often exaggerated .  Papez therefore located the emotional behaviour mechanisms in the brainstem ,  especially in the mammillary bodies which ,  he believed ,  received sensory information via subcortical relay routes ,  and cognitive information from the cerebral cortex via the hippocampus and its subcortical projection system ,  the fornix .  Emotional experience , on the other hand , he thought was the result of <head>activating</head> specific areas of the cerebral cortex in much the same way as activating other areas produced visual or auditory experience . On the basis of some remarkably weak clinical evidence he decided that the site of emotional experience was the cingulate gyrus ,  which lies on the medial surface of the hemispheres .  All of the areas that Papez implicated in emotion are part of an anatomically identified system known  as the limbic system .

It is wrong because you can eliminate all of the possible sensory mechanisms that might detect the tissue disturbance produced by a particular form of deprivation and motivation still persists .  For example ,  cutting the nerve supply to the genitals does not interfere with sexual motivation in the short term ;  cutting the nerves to the stomach does not interfere with hunger .  This led Morgan ( 1943 ) to argue that drive must be due to <head>activating</head> a central nervous system mechanism that represents the drive state , much in the same way as Papez was claiming that activation of the cingulate cortex represented emotion . Morgan did not know where to locate the source of this central motive state in the nervous system .  It was Stellar  ( 1954 )  who put the finger on the hypothalamus as the seat of motivation ,  basing his arguments on a number of lesion studies that had shown quite specific disturbances of motivation after lesions in this region .

The system is designed so that it will learn to generate output patterns in response to input patterns .  It can do this because the capacity of an input neuron to activate any of the output neurons increases every time the output pattern generator activates the output neuron simultaneously with external activation of the input neuron .  After a number of such pairings a particular pattern of input will come to evoke a selected output pattern , without the output pattern generator being <head>activated</head> . Associative learning will have taken place .  This system is ,  by  definition ,  interactive since every input neuron can affect every output neuron .

This is most clearly seen in studies of the primate visual cortex  ( Maunsell and Newsome 1987 )  .  Visual field representations are mapped by sampling successive locations in the visual cortex with a microelectrode and ,  at each location ,  determining where you have to place a stimulus in the visual field to activate single cells at that location .  You find that cells in adjacent parts of the visual cortex are <head>activated</head> by stimulation in adjacent parts of the visual field . The cortex is said to be retinotopically mapped .

The HER - 2/neu  oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase ,  p185 erbB2    ( ref .  32 )  ,  which is structurally related to the EGF receptor and to erbB3  ( ref .  34 )  .  Additionally ,  p185 erbB2   is expressed on the surface of Schwann cells and is upregulated during wallerian degeneration and also by exposure to forskolin ,  which potentiates the mitogenic response to GGF .  As the recombinant GGFs described here and several putative p185 erbB2 ligands are products of the same gene , we reasoned that bovine pituitary GGFs and rhGGF - II might <head>activate</head> a p185 receptor tyrosine kinase ( perhaps erbB2 ) on Schwann cells . Therefore we analysed tyrosine phosphorylation of Schwann cell protein by western blotting  ( Fig. 3 )  .  This demonstrated that Schwann cells treated with either native or recombinant GGFs phosphorylated  ( on tyrosine )  a protein of 185K .

Using peptide sequence information derived from purified bovine glial growth factors ,  we have isolated several clones that encode Schwann cell mitogenic activities .  The group of proteins encoded by these transcripts includes the three described glial growth factors  ( ref .  22 ,  and A.D.J.G .  et al. ,   manuscript submitted )  and several proteins  ( heregulins and Neu differentiation factor )  that have various activities on cultured breast tumour cells .  The heregulins and NDF are specific activators of the p185 erbB2 receptor and rhGGF - II <head>activates</head> the phosphorylation of a Schwann cell protein that is similar in size to p185 erbB2 . Based on several lines of evidence ,  including the data presented here ,  we suggest that various p185 erbB2  ligands ,  such as the GGFs ,  are important in development ,  regeneration and tumour formation in the nervous system .  A critical stage in the development of the peripheral nervous system is the projection of axons to their targets ,  the ensheathment of these axons and their subsequent myelination by Schwann cells .

This is consistent with the idea that DNA binding and therefore transactivation by Myc requires association with Max  ( either Max1 or Max2 )  or at least the Max bHLH - Z domain  ( Max85 ;  Figs 1 and 2 a  )  .  Unlike VP16 - Myc  N ,  Max103 - VP16 by itself transactivates the CACGTG - CYC1 promoter  ( Fig. 2 b  )  .  Thus , Max can bind DNA in the absence of Myc but does not significantly <head>activate</head> transcription in our system unless tagged with a heterologous transactivation domain . Accordingly ,  all Max proteins tested  ( Fig. 1 )  bind DNA as homo - oligomers in yeast extracts  ( ref .  9 ,  and data not shown )  ,  as recently reported for bacterially expressed Max .  Transactivation of the CACGTG - CYC1 promoter is sequence - specific ,  as much less or no transactivation by Myc+Max  ( Fig. 2 a  ,  lanes a )  ,  VP16 - Myc  N+Max or Max103 - VP16  ( Fig. 2 b  )  is observed from a control reporter lacking the CACGTG binding site  ( see also Fig. 2 a  legend )  .

A purse - string mechanism based on a contractile cable fits the observations of others who have investigated embryonic wound healing and seen similar patterns of epidermal movement .  But it does not apply to minute epidermal lesions that leave the basal lamina intact ,  or to embryonic epidermal cells moving on a rigid adhesive substratum in culture :  here the conventional mechanism of epidermal crawling seems to operate .  Two central questions arise : what initiates the formation of the actin cable , and what <head>activates</head> its contraction and the associated cell rearrangements ? The experiments of Kolega are illuminating here .  Stress applied to a migrating epidermal cell at right angles to its direction of movement  ( tangential to the leading edge of its lamellipodium )  causes the lamellipodium to retract and brings about a reorganization of the cell 's  actin into a cable oriented along the major axis of stress .

These findings ,  together with our previous observation of an unidentified   t   - resistant PLC in HL - 60 granulocytes and our unpublished observation that purified PLC -   1  showed no response to   t  ,  strongly suggest that the stimulation of PLC -  2  by   t  is specific for members of the PLC -    subfamily and is isozyme - selective within this group of PLCs .  Clearly , PLC - 1 is <head>activated</head> by all four members of the q family ( q , 11 , 14 , and 16 ) . PLC -  2  seems to be resistant to stimulation by   q  ,   11  ,   and  14  ,   but sensitive to stimulation by  16    ( refs 9 ,  10 )  .  Our finding that both PLC -  1  and PLC -  2  are stimulated by   subunits strongly suggests that these PLCs ,  similar to the type II and IV adenylyl cyclases ,  are regulated by both G protein  -   and   subunits .

The significance of these protocols is that synchronized firing patterns at similar frequencies occur in the hippocampus during learning .  )  LTP is characterized by three basic properties :  cooperativity ,  associativity and input - specificity .  Cooperativity describes the existence of an intensity threshold for induction ; weak tetani , <head>activating</head> relatively few afferent fibres , do not trigger LTP . The threshold for inducing LTP is a complex function of the intensity and pattern of tetanic stimulation ;  between weak trains which produce only PTP and strong trains which induce LTP ,  lies an intermediate range of activation which engages STP .  LTP is associative in the sense that a weak input can be potentiated if it is active at the same time as a strong tetanus to a separate but convergent input .

The properties of cooperativity ,  associativity and input - specificity can now easily be explained .  The cooperativity threshold follows from the need for depolarization to reduce the level of the Mg 2+  block of the NMDA channel .  Weak stimuli , activating only a few fibres , fail to induce LTP not because insufficient L - glutamate is released to <head>activate</head> NMDA receptors , but because the level of depolarization provided by the weak input does not produce an adequate reduction of the Mg 2+ block . When many fibres are activated in synchrony by a strong stimulus ,  depolarization spreads between neighbouring synapses to enhance the unblocking of NMDA channels .  Associativity has a similar explanation except that the required depolarization is provided by a different set of afferent fibres ;  in theory ,  these helper inputs could use any neurotransmitter that promotes depolarization ,  and ,  experimentally ,  depolarization is often provided by injecting current into the cell .

But the selectivity of H - 7 for potentiated pathways has been challenged ,  and other PKC inhibitors that act on the catalytic subunit ,  including K - 252b  ( ref .  85 )  ,  are not able to depotentiate fully established LTP .  There is also disagreement as to whether the sustained kinase activity that might be necessary for LTP is located within the postsynaptic cell or not. A recent view is that a postsynaptic kinase is <head>activated</head> transiently ( for less than a few minutes following the tetanus ) and a presynaptic kinase is activated for longer periods ( but for less than 1 hour ) . These kinases might be the   and   isoforms of PKC ,  respectively .  Intracellular injection of the catalytic subunit of PKC induces synaptic potentiation as does the extracellular application of activators of PKC ,  such as certain phorbol esters .

This unsaturated fatty acid satisfies several of the requirements for a retrograde messenger :   ( 1 )  it is released from cultured neurons into the extracellular medium by the activation of NMDA receptors ,   ( 2 )  there is an increase in its efflux and postsynaptic availability following the induction of LTP ,   ( 3 )  inhibitors of phospholipase A 2  ,  an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid from phospholipids ,  block the induction of LTP r134135  ,  and  ( 4 )  the transient application of arachidonic acid to hippocampal synapses causes a slow - onset potentiation .  Potential targets for arachidonic acid include not only the presynaptic terminal ,  where it may act to increase L - glutamate release ,  but also glial cells where it depresses L - glutamate uptake and the postsynaptic cell ,  where ,  for example ,  it can potentiate NMDA receptor - mediated currents .  Another phospholipase A 2 - derived lipid , platelet - <head>activating</head> factor , also has some of the properties expected of a retrograde messenger .

The amplified Ca 2+  signal ,  in association with the other activators of protein kinases  ( zig - zag arrows )  ,  then leads to the phosphorylation of substrate proteins including ,  probably ,  AMPA and NMDA receptors .  Other enzymes , such as nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) , if present , may also be <head>activated</head> by the Ca 2+ transient . Biochemical changes in the presynaptic terminal may be initiated by the action of retrograde messengers ,  such as arachidonic acid  ( AA )  ,  nitric oxide  ( NO )  and K +  ,  perhaps in conjunction with the action of L - glutamate on presynaptic mGluRs .

Gaston Pflgl ,  Jrg Kallen ,  Tilman Schirmer ,  Johan N. Jansonius ,  Mauro G. M. Zurini  Malcolm D. Walkinshaw HUMAN cyclophilin A  ( CypA )  ,  a ubiquitous intracellular protein of 165 amino acids ,  is the major receptor for the cyclic undecapeptide immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A  ( CsA )  ,  which prevents allograft rejection after transplant surgery and is efficacious in the field of autoimmune diseases .  CsA prevents T - cell proliferation by blocking the calcium - <head>activated</head> pathway leading to interleukin - 2 transcription . Besides their ability to bind CsA ,  the cyclophilin isoforms also have peptidyl - prolyl isomerase activity and enhance the rate of protein folding .  The macrolide FK506 acts similarly to CsA and its cognate receptor FKBP also has peptidyl - prolyl isomerase activity .

This pattern persists up to 9.5d.p.c .   (  c )   when both stripes of expression are at their strongest .  At 10.0d.p.c .   ( d )   Krox - 20  expression begins to be downregulated in r3 and is followed ,  at 10.5d.p.c .   (  e )   by the downregulation of expression in r5 ;  f - j   ( lateral views )  and f ' j '  (   dorsal views )  show that retinoic acid treatment alters this pattern .  The gene is not initially <head>activated</head> in r3 at 8.25 d.p.c . as shown in f  and f '  .  At 8.5 d.p.c .
