Her college library has interesting books ,  as well as the latest art magazines .  Her course teacher has given her a reading list ,  and the library staff are good at helping students with all sorts of interests .  As part of the course , she has to choose a subject of her own about which to write a paper ; one of her <head>difficulties</head> is to know how to form her own views , not just copy already received opinions . She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ;  it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic ,  since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome ,  and although there were plenty of books about it ,  many of them went into extravagant detail .  Happily her supervisor has guided more than one student through topics about Michelangelo ,  and has a route map prepared ,  including introductory and background books ,  but also passages from longer scholarly works .

For example ,  this is a passage of interpretive description of a Van Gogh self - portrait :   his emaciated ,  luminous head with its burning eyes set off against a whirlpool of darkness .  I want to paint men and women with that something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize ,  Van Gogh had written ,  groping to define for his brother the human essence that was his aim in pictures such as this .  In other passages , the reader may find more <head>difficulty</head> in following Janson 's judgement . Here is a passage which shows that a survey can benefit from being used with other books  ( even though three of the sculptures mentioned are illustrated by Janson )  .  Antoine Coysevox ,  a less self - conscious classicist than Girardon ,  was another sculptor employed by Lebrun at Versailles .

These functions have been well carried out by Baedeker guides since the foundation of the German firm in the first part of the nineteenth century .  Old copies are now collectors items ,  with their entertaining instructions and hints .  In 1909 : The unattached cyclist on entering Italy with his wheel must deposit 42 fr . 60c . with the custom - house authorities , which sum is returned to him ( though seldom without <head>difficulties</head> ) when he quits the country . Baedeker acquired a reputation for serious standards ,  and the traveller who missed a double - asterisked attraction had clearly journeyed in vain .  Baedeker in 1909 ,  like Reynolds in his fifth discourse ,  hesitated between two great masters and their works .

I must admit therefore that there is one passage in this otherwise consummate design  (  A Fruit Dish  )  of which the meaning escapes me .  I cannot see the necessity of the shadow cast by a half - opened drawer in the kitchen table .  ,  It is encouraging to find Fry underlining a point about critical writing  that with a description of a work of art it can be useful to be given an explicit account of how the critic responds .  Another point is also made explicitly . : his <head>difficulty</head> is assessing Czanne 's work at the end of the century . It is more difficult to be precise about this than about the earlier phases ,  partly because the pictures are rarer and less accessible ,  and have not been adequately photographed ,  partly because it includes considerable variations .  Fry 's  book contains rather little biographical information ,  the focus being firmly on Czanne 's  work .

The catalogue of the earlier Italian schools was written by Martin Davies ,  and published in 1951 .  the strength of the gallery 's  holding of works by Giovanni Bellini made it worth the author 's  while to write a preliminary note about difficulties of attribution :  A definition of Bellini 's  oeuvre is one of the hardest problems in the history of painting .  The first <head>difficulty</head> is , despite the destructions , the enormous number of existing pictures , many of them signed , and in one way or another more or less Bellinesque . It is obvious that Bellini had assistants to help him in his studio ;  indeed ,  there is documentary proof of that .  But the question of what pictures are entirely or for practical purposes Bellini 's  own is answered largely by personal taste ;  there is therefore a considerable divergence of view .

A climate of artistic opinion is as tricky to predict as the English weather ,  and also quite as changeable .  Both writers and readers are affected by generally accepted ideas ,  without necessarily having given them independent thought .  One <head>difficulty</head> in describing a climate of opinion is this fact : that many shared views are not stated openly , but assumed . A set of assumptions may be challenged by an outsider ,  and at this moment these shared views come into focus .  To look at the work of an art critic in this way we have to turn to historians of taste for the past and to journalists for the present .

That is better still !  David was greatly encouraged by this warm admiration expressed by a celebrated man ,  and it helped to develop his talent .  Reviews of exhibiting societies ' shows have constantly presented <head>difficulties</head> to critics , as it is only possible to give brief comments on some of the artists ' work ; how could it be otherwise when an exhibiting society shows several thousand works ? During the nineteenth century to be noticed was good fortune ,  while to be praised was a professional advantage .  Exhibiting societies ,  once established ,  bred rivals ;  the most remarkable rivalry in the nineteenth century was in Paris ,  where the choice of pictures for the Salon in 1866 was so generally considered to be unfair that the rejected pictures were shown in a Salon of their own .

In The Emperor  he writes :  For the starvelings it had to suffice that His Munificent Highness personally attached the greatest importance to their fate ,  which was a very special kind of attachment ,  of an order higher than the highest .  It provided the subjects with a soothing and uplifting hope that whenever there appeared in their lives an oppressive mischance , some tormenting <head>difficulty</head> , His Most Unrivalled Highness would hearten them by attaching the greatest importance to that mischance or difficulty . The Emperor  has something of the technique of comic and fantastic exaggeration that we associate with Dickens ,  and something of the manner ,  too ,  of Dickens 's  reader ,  Kafka :  In the courtyard where the Emperor s retinue awaited him ,  there were tens ,  no ,  I say it without exaggeration ,  hundreds eager to push their faces forward .

As the years go by ,  Ursula 's  body becomes a bore ,  and she experiences a fear of ageing :  I shall have to die fairly young ,  because I wo n't be able to live with the infirmities of old age .  She is indeed ready to die , and it is a <head>difficulty</head> that Justin may feel that he has to do the same . In the Sudan she declares :  My time is up.

She displays more sympathy for this anti - Semitic Moses ,  for this religious man who is against Jews and against the Soviet system ,  than she does for Jews who are not religious .  Whether or not she has talked to God ,  she has certainly been reviewing for him. Levi , the expert on metals , would have had no <head>difficulty</head> in telling the difference between gold and tin . I have heard that he was saddened by these writings of Fernanda Eberstadt 's  ,  in which his own writings are faulted .  Two months after the Herling piece was published Levi committed suicide ,  throwing himself down the staircase of the house in Turin where he was born and grew up ,  where he wrote about his life in the camp at a desk which stood where his cradle had stood ,  a house he shared with his wife and mother .

A play really demands to be read aloud  - it needs the sound of the human voice to bring it alive .  It takes imagination and a lot of practice to read a play to yourself in the same time as it would take to see it on the stage .  Surprisingly , this is true of both the classical and modern play , though you might expect that the obscurities and <head>difficulties</head> of words and expression would prove more of a stumbling block in , say , Shakespeare or Ben Jonson . Here is a suggested first reading list ,  which I 've put together to provide a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's  development .  There is a danger in reading the classics ,  in that they can come to be regarded simply as literature  so always try to look at them as plays for performance   and ,  it goes without saying ,  try to see as much theatre as you can .

I have declined to act as external examiner to candidates whose subject or thesis title seemed to be so dubious that a successful treatment of it could only be done by a candidate of exceptional brilliance ;  in such cases it is likely that the candidate has had inadequate or misguided supervision .

Much <head>difficulty</head> could be avoided if the only candidates permitted to work for a PhD were those who were virtually certain to obtain it , but that is not a feasible option in the modern university . Similar considerations make me sometimes decline to examine students from foreign parts .  This is not because of xenophobia ,  still less racism ;  prudence is the principal consideration .

The problems are not universal ,  one must emphasize .  Some students ,  particularly those from the Indian subcontinent who have been selected for Commonwealth Scholarships ,  are capable of performing very well at higher degree level ,  and then returning to an academic career in their own countries .  When overseas students do present <head>difficulties</head> and I am sure many academics will be familiar with distressing or scandalous cases it is not because they are lacking in industry or intellectual ability . Many of them would do perfectly well in disciplines which are less idiosyncratic than English and have a more obvious international currency ,  like linguistics or economics or marketing .  But in this respect ,  at least ,  English in the English academy ,  as Leavis liked to emphasize ,  is not just another subject .
